Never try to hate anyone; often they don't care, and you're left doing all the work.</h3><p><em>\"Said by a friend of mine at a very critical time in my life. It's been said in other ways, but that one stuck with me for the last 35+ years.\"</em></p><p><em>\"Makes me think of this gem: Never get in a fight with a pig. You both get covered in sh*t but the pig enjoys it.\"</em></p><p><em></em><em>\"Hate corrodes the vessel it's carried in.\"</em></p><h3>3. Have you had a bad day, or did you have a bad 5 minutes that you let ruin your day?</h3><p><em>\"I love this one explained with money. If I gave you $100, then I stole 5, would you burn/throw away the rest?\"</em></p><p><em>\"I need someone to remind me of this sometimes!

Living well is the best revenge!</h3><p><em>\"Instead of making yourself miserable stewing over the past, improve your life and make yourself happy.\"</em></p><p><em>\"For the people that hate you, or just generally dislike you, there's nothing worse than seeing you be happy. If someone hurts you on purpose, you don't need to try and hurt them back, if you become obsessed with them, then they've won, but being happy and leading a good life is the best revenge you could have, because they'll hate to see it. If you can't love yourself for you, love yourself just out of spite towards the people who would bring you down.\"</em></p><h3>10. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good enough.</h3><p><em>\"This is a good one in the professional world. I give this advice to my direct reports often. Move onto the next great thing.\"</em></p><h3>11. Acceptance is the answer</h3><p><em>\"Big Book AA: Acceptance is the answer to all my problems today. When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing or situation—some fact of my life—unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment.\"</em></p><p><em>\"It changed my life… I was so consumed with everything that was wrong around me.

After all, right-handed you is actually <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/mans-delight-at-getting-left-handed-scissors-has-lefties-everywhere-sharing-the-joy\" target=\"_blank\">left-handed</a> you in the mirror. Right? (Wait,<em> is</em> that right?)</p><p><a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/why-did-scientists-give-a-mirror-to-these-weird-fish-we-have-5-ideas\" target=\"_blank\">Mirrors can be confusing,</a> despite not being very complicated. A mirror image is simply a reflection of what's before it. But when <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/dove-is-challenging-beauty-standards-by-banning-the-world-normal-from-all-of-its-products\" target=\"_blank\">someone else is looking at us</a> head on, they don't see text in reverse, so why don't we see what other people see when we see ourselves in a mirror?</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"3a931\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDEzNDE5Ny9vcmlnaW4uZ2lmIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4MzY0NTI3NX0.a4icsbsKNiamvYwT3hZWKao7SZhUnDrOYcgdxDv-Sx8/img.gif?width=980\" />\n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Kitten Aww GIF by MOODMAN</small>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">\n            <a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/1wnZSnmrnwJmnJkd1c\" target=\"_blank\">Giphy</a>\n        </small>\n        </p><p>(If you think this is a super stupid question with a super obvious answer, congratulations. Pat yourself on the back and scootch along so the folks who don't fully grasp the physics of mirrors can enjoy a demonstration that makes it a little easier to understand.) </p><p>\"Why do mirrors reverse text?\" asks the creator behind <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/QBnBxLQTmHY\" target=\"_blank\">@humanteneleven on YouTube</a>. \"You might think it's just a property of mirrors—they flip things from left to right—but that's not true.\" He then picks up a metal arrow to show that it points the same direction in the mirror as it does in real life. So why is the text flipped when the arrow isn't?</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">- YouTube</small>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">\n            \n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/QBnBxLQTmHY\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com</a>\n\n        </small>\n        </p><p>He then holds up a book to show how the text on the book cover appears backwards, just like the shirt. But when he holds up a <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/jennifer-garner-shows-how-a-random-act-of-kindness-can-begin-with-a-ziploc-bag-ex1\" target=\"_blank\">Ziploc bag</a> with the word \"HELLO\" written on it, the word shows up properly. </p><p>That's because he had to flip the book over to see the cover text in the mirror. The baggy he could just hold up and see the letters through the transparent plastic, just as we see them in real life. If he flips the baggy over like he did the book, the text shows up backwards in the mirror, just like it does in real life.</p><p>\"So it's actually not the mirror that's flipping anything from left to right,\" he says. \"It's the human.\"</p><p>People appreciated the simple, straightforward explanation and demonstrations.</p><p>\"One of the most insightful demonstrations I've seen.

It even uses a visual diagram to explain:</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">- YouTube</small>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">\n            \n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wvkyAJS198\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com</a>\n\n        </small>\n        </p>\n            <p>And for those who say, \"This is so basic! How do people not understand this?\" here's a video that really does get into the nitty gritty physics and geometry of how mirrors work, diving into ray and wave optics, photons, wave functions, probability, and quantum mechanics. It's only 12 minutes, and it manages to entertain while explaining, but it certainly blows the notion that understanding mirrors is super simple. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">- YouTube</small>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">\n            \n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYLzxcU6ROM\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com</a>\n\n        </small>\n        </p>\n            <p>As one commenter wrote, \"I thought I understood mirrors.

Plus, having no phone for when they were at the house alone didn’t seem like a good idea. Not to mention this didn’t really address the “being able to hold a conversation” issue. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img alt=\"phones, kids and smartphone, kid phone addictions, kids and screens, limiting screen time, old school phone\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8bb6f\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDEzNDE4MS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5MTE2NDU3MH0.ckE3DHIrDioESu7j2hTKRtHinKPfYRZa-SnYdUpnQes/img.png?width=980\" />\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">@momsoforegon/<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DHtzS8yysB_/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>,</small></p>\n<p>That’s when they had the idea to install a home phone.

Mast told <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DHtzS8yysB_/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Today</u></a> that she did opt for an internet-enabled phone, since installing an actual landline is “annoying nowadays.”</p>\n<p>So far, the experience with “old” technology has been a success. Rather than seeing it as a chore, Mast told<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DHtzS8yysB_/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u> Today</u></a> that they saw it as a “toy,’ and thoroughly enjoyed learning the ins and outs of phone etiquette. </p>\n<p>“They love calling Grammy all on their own 🥰” Mast wrote in an Instagram post.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img alt=\"phones, kids and smartphone, kid phone addictions, kids and screens, limiting screen time, old school phone\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"1f33a\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDEzNDE4Mi9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1ODM4MjQ0Mn0.U-NjjVCtI76JmHb1UpCvOmYp0PB7HggZIAqt96FkDYk/img.png?width=980\" />\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">@momsoforegon/<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DHtzS8yysB_/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>,</small></p>\n<p>This is an interesting sentiment. We hear so many lamentations about kids today being “addicted” to technology and abysmally uninterested in social connections, but, as with most things, infusing a bit of novelty can get kids interested in a nanosecond. </p>\n<p>And apparently, Mast isn’t the only one to try—and find success with—incorpating \"ancient technology\" back into the home. </p>\n<p>“Yes! We got one when our kids could stay home alone. My girls are 14 and still don’t have cell phones. We will get them flip phones next year when they start high school. 👏👏👏👏” one fellow parent wrote. </p>\n<p>Another shared, “Yes!!!! We did this. I hope this becomes a trend over the next few years. Force these kids to have to have actual conversations! 3 ways calling, no texts.😂”</p>\n<p>And the folks who haven’t tried it…well, they’re sold on the idea, for sure. </p>\n<p>“We will be doing this too! Can not wait!!!!”</p>\n<p>“I love this! Can’t wait till we’re in this phase.”</p>\n<p>It’s great to have devices like Google home and Alexa, but we all seem to be feeling the toll of a completely streamlined lifestyle. At this point, devices that force us to slow down are a major luxury. And that especially goes for kids, whose developing brains truly cannot handle such constant stimulation. As we strive for a more balanced relationship with technology as a society, we can probably expect a resurgence of a few more retro items. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img alt=\"phones, kids and smartphone, kid phone addictions, kids and screens, limiting screen time, old school phone\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"cdf32\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDEzNDE4My9vcmlnaW4uZ2lmIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MDE3NzQ0MX0.g4GEaaMHbetU3HnM829V5_KN5VEuN9TXHEqnFZqZJas/img.gif?width=980\" />\n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">\n            \n    <a href=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/hpEe7TfQfVm2ZOdUJK/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47rj2jeyvpsz77tkwrzijiahomcvjogioolu4uuvmn&amp;ep=v1_gifs_search&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g\" target=\"_blank\">media.giphy.com</a>\n\n        </small>\n        </p>\n<p>In fact, Mast apparently has introduced a few more throwbacks, like CD players for her kids' bedroom.They also might be getting some secondhand Gameboys.

And that doesn’t just mean they get to see the sunrise: in <a href=\"https://www.bhg.com.au/lifestyle/the-best-time-to-wake-up/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">another study</a> conducted by Emma Sleep, 90% of Australians who woke up before 6am reported that they stuck to a morning routine; 75% said that they prioritized good habits, like making the bed; and 91% said that they never hit the snooze button. Talk about intense.</p><p><br /></p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"></div><p>Pre-dawn fitness, time by the beach, piping hot coffee, and unique breakfast foods. Australia’s vibrant early morning culture is a wonder, one that’s centered around joy and embracing those AM hours most of us try to sleep through. And although it sounds a bit dogmatic, the early riser lifestyle works: Australians who wake up early are reportedly more productive and happier. So, ready to unlock the magic of mornings, Aussie-style? (No, you won’t have to torture yourself with 5 AM alarms, promise.)</p><ul> </ul> <h3>First up, exercise</h3> <p>Before heading to work or to school, many Australians start their day with exercise classes, surfing, or some other outdoor activity. “I’m all about not setting the bar impossibly high,” <a href=\"https://womenshealth.com.au/morning-routines-of-successful-people/\" target=\"_blank\">says</a> Turia Pitt, an endurance athlete and motivational speaker, about her morning routine. “At the moment, exercise is more about clearing my head and feeling good about myself, rather than hitting fitness goals. Anything outdoors is always my preference: trail running, surfing or just taking [my son] Hakavai for lots of long walks.”</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Australia, hike, happiness, morning, routine. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"2602d\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDEyMTE3NS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MTE3NDA5MH0.laKqnAFA7hQ7irk2jWc3ZyczFSy2FKnu4gX2_XAU1j0/img.png?width=980\" />\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Exercise is high up on an Australian's to-do list. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Photo credit: Canva</a></small></p><p>It’s no surprise then, that a number of global fitness brands <a href=\"https://www.insidehook.com/wellness/morning-routine-australians\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">started in Australia</a>, including <a href=\"https://f45training.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">F45 Training</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCll23NJMosmS1cvbqLwtdhQ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">12RND Fitness</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bodyfittraining.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Body Fit Training</a>, <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Australian-morning-culture-1e6d2abaf89e80d9bcf9dd7b5cb73842?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">KX Pilates</a>, <a href=\"https://happymelon.com.au/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Happy Melon Studios</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Australian-morning-culture-1e6d2abaf89e80d9bcf9dd7b5cb73842?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Flow Athletic</a>.</p><ul> </ul> <h3>Crazy coffee culture</h3> <p>Everything changed for Australia when Italian and Greek immigrants brought espresso machines to the continent in the 1950s. Although coffee itself had <a href=\"https://bizcup.com.au/australian-coffee-culture/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">been in the country</a> since the late 1700s, it wasn’t until this wave of European immigrants—who brought with them their cafe traditions—that sparks really began to fly. Today, Australia is home to one of the world’s greatest coffee scenes, with a strong emphasis on skill and high bean quality. Oh, and don’t forget the <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/what-is-a-flat-white-coffee\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">flat white</a>, the coffee drink that originated in Australia and New Zealand: a delicious double shot of espresso, a bit of steamed milk, and the thinnest layer of velvety micro-foam.</p><p><br /></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Coffee, Flat White, Australia, morning, routine.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f51c0\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDEyMTI2My9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1ODgzODEzMn0.MWe4dcatcw3SKyq87NOevLgCX3mxWAb4VhV2ojFNB18/img.png?width=980\" />\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A nice Flat White is the perfect way to start the day.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Photo credit: Canva</a></small></p><p>There’s also a broader social aspect that accompanies Australia’s coffee ritual.

The Australian breakfast, or “brekkie,” as its affectionately called, is hearty. Beyond their beloved avocado toast, you’ll find a blend of American and British colonial influences. There’s the <a href=\"https://www.kayak.co.uk/news/australian-breakfast/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">“fry-up</a>,” a hot plate featuring smokey bacon, eggs in whatever way you like them, grilled mushrooms and tomatoes, a delightful grain, like buttery toast—or even better, toast spread with vegemite. This substantial brekkie, among others like <a href=\"https://weetbix.com.au/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Weet-Bix</a> (a slab of whole-grain wheat cereal) or <a href=\"https://www.womensweeklyfood.com.au/recipe/quick-and-easy/sweet-corn-fritters-3336/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sweetcorn fritters</a> provides the energy necessary for an active morning and productive day, which is why they’ve remained staples across generations.</p><p>“I’m quite creative in the mornings, so I channel that time to focus on projects like writing for my books, app and program. I move into more admin and email tasks later in the day,” <a href=\"https://womenshealth.com.au/morning-routines-of-successful-people/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">advises</a> Jessica Sepel, an Aussie nutritionist and <a href=\"https://jessicasepel.com/books/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bestselling author</a>, when it comes to morning productivity. “Taking a full weekend off – and limiting social media use – helps me to be more productive during the week. Rest is underrated.”</p><p><br /></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Breakfast, sausage, mushrooms, Australian, fry-up\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"401f7\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDEyMTMyOC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NzE3NjczMH0.Vytl49o2SpyHp7yLsuaKg7gWUfQvTAE1b-2vW1lPsaA/img.png?width=980\" />\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A gorgeous Australian fry-up. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Photo credit: Canva</a></small></p><ul> </ul> <p>The Australian approach isn’t about “punishing” yourself, or making your body wake up or do unnatural things. It’s quite the opposite: Aussies discover what works best for their body and mind, using a unique blend of values to guide them including vitality, community, quality, and pragmatism.</p><p>Or, as Turia Pitt <a href=\"https://womenshealth.com.au/morning-routines-of-successful-people/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">says</a>, “It sounds dramatic, but my morning strategies have changed my life! Do not look at your phone first thing. Getting sucked down the digital vortex is not a positive way to start the day.”</p><p>So, whether it’s a dip in the ocean at sunrise, a moment with friends with coffee, or simply enjoying an avocado toast, there are many lessons to be learned from Australia and their early morning culture. Wellness, community, fitness, and pleasure can all be achieved with a little extra time in the morning.</p>",

And as it turns out, the most romantic moments often aren't the fancy, candlelight dinners or the view from the highest floor or the sunset walk on the beach. Often, the sweetest and most memorable moments aren't the ones you plan, but rather when something silly or accidental or unexpected happens.</p><p>That's why when someone asked, \"What's an oddly romantic thing that's happened to you on a date?\" people's responses had people swooning. </p>\n        \n        <div class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"97e33\">\n            <blockquote class=\"reddit-card\">\n                <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/1kczl4z/cutest_thing_ever/\"></a> from <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile\">MadeMeSmile</a>\n            </blockquote>\n        </div>\n    \n    <p>The initial response to the question read, \"Was on a date with a guy and we kissed and his watch started beep[ing] really loud and we looked down and it said 'abnormal heart rate detected' lol.\" That story prompted people to start sharing their own unique romantic moments.</p><h3>Pulse goes up. Pulse goes down.</h3><p>\"Was dating my now-wife and she had some medical issue that took her to the ER. She’s hooked up to the monitor and I’m sitting at the side of the bed facing all the machines. I notice that when I hold her hand her pulse goes up and when I let go it goes down.</p><p>This leads me to laugh a bit and, when she asks, explain how 'Pulse goes up, Pulse goes down!' by holding her hand. She blushes adorably and I kiss her and it’s all cute. It became a cute little thing I tease her about.</p><p>Years later and the situation is reversed—I’m in the ER and she’s come in to visit me. I’m sitting in bed talking to her when she suddenly gets sad and pouty.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img alt=\"romantic stories, pulse, heartrate, love stories, love\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"5d8c2\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDE0MTIwNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgwOTc1OTAxMn0.pFIc_LTcBnGiRH9ESeD3DN4bIq0no2iTqEuHlTJbfzU/img.jpg?width=980\" />\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">\"Pulse goes pp, Pulse goes sown.\"</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Photo credit: Canva</a></small></p><p>I ask what’s wrong and she says how she was watching the monitor and testing “Pulse goes up!” but my pulse goes down when she holds my hand.</p><p>I say 'Of course it does.

This homeless guy stopped us while we’re walking and asked for money. We give him some cash, and as he’s leaving he shouts 'I HOPE YALL HAVE SOME BEAUTIFUL BABIES!' 😭😭 It was awkward for the rest of the walk lmaooo, but we did in fact have some beautiful babies, and more to come lol.\"</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img alt=\"aww, gif, couples, dates, love stories\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"87cc3\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDE0MTIwMS9vcmlnaW4uZ2lmIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MzcwNzI1NH0.8lG16fh948Gji94wrE9H6LUsjsfG-2BJLDnRuakE4JA/img.gif?width=980\" />\n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Tv Land Awww GIF by Throwing Shade</small>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">\n            <a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/throwingshade-tv-land-tvland-26gslmOUHAyAURVGo\" target=\"_blank\">Giphy</a>\n        </small>\n        </p><h3>Tiny footprints</h3><p>\"The first time I ever picked up my wife in my car she drew little feet using the palm of her hands on my passenger window.

Simply reminded me of her every time and it put a big dumb grin on my face.\"</p><h3>Bloody kisses</h3><p>\"Lol reminds me of when my husband and I were dating long distance.

I almost swooned.\"</p><h3>A simple touch</h3><p>\"First date, we went to dinner + a movie on Valentine's Day. I left my lights on, so I had to call CAA to get a jump. It was -20 so we had to snuggle up tight to preserve bodily warmth. When we parted, she reached out and touched my face, and I just about died.. I always felt I was very ugly, and to have her accept my face just broke my heart (in a good way.)</p><p>Married now, and I look back on my bonehead maneuver on that first date as having been essential.

We went ice skating at PPG place around the Christmas tree and then took the incline up to look at the skyline. I’m from the Pittsburgh area and he is from Southern WV. He came up early from Thanksgiving break when we were in undergrad and grad school respectively at WVU. He was all in on the cheesy rom-com moments and made me feel like a Princess.</p><p>Turns out not only does he hate ice skating, he is afraid of heights, and also a die hard Cincinnati Bengals fan who didn’t even flip off Heinz field once. This man did a slew of things he hated and never complained or whined because he could tell I was having so much fun. I am incredibly lucky to have him and I’ve never made him ice skate again.\"</p><p>Here's to those surprising romantic moments that form some of our sweetest memories with our loved ones.</p>",

Why? Well, you just have to see it in action.</p><p>One video begins by showing a hole in a light pink knit sweater. Using a needle, yarn and a tiny latch hook device, the person demonstrates how to fill the hole to make it look as if it never existed in the first place. Putting a patch over a hole is one thing, but this is something akin to magic.</p><p>Watch:</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">- YouTube</small>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">\n            \n    <a href=\"https://youtube.com/shorts/afhD49RsRIk?si=0aiqfy2JZnjC5V3A\" target=\"_blank\">youtube.com</a>\n\n        </small>\n        </p>\n            <p>Wow, right?</p><p>Another video begins by showing a hole in a gray knit sweater, but this time a yellow yarn is used to patch the hole so you can see clearly what was done. It looks so simple, but you really do have to know what you're doing to make this magic work.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">- YouTube</small>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">\n            \n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GXTzJCzD7D4\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com</a>\n\n        </small>\n        </p><p>What we're witnessing here is a combo of knowledge and experience in the <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/this-92-year-olds-knit-hats-are-warming-homeless-people-his-story-will-warm-your-heart\" target=\"_self\">fiber arts</a>, of course, but what it looks like is sheer sorcery or some kind of really complicated calculus problem. Who figured out how to do this? And why is it <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/video-everyday-things-made-in-30-seconds\" target=\"_self\">so satisfying</a> to watch?</p><p>\"I watched this whole video and I still don’t know how you did that,\" shared one commenter. (Right?!)</p><p>\"Hey that was pretty neat,\" wrote another. \"Can you do the ozone layer next?\" (Ha.)</p><p>\"I could watch it a hundred times and still not be able to do this,\" wrote another. (Uh, same.)</p><p>\"My toxic trait is thinking I can do this 😂😂😂,\" shared another. (Maybe after watching it <em>two</em> hundred times.)</p><p>Many people found it oddly soothing to watch, perhaps because seeing something being fixed is indeed satisfying and perhaps because it harkens back to a simpler time when people spent their evenings doing things like this around the fire. </p><p>The music helps, too. This video demonstrates three different ways to mend sweater holes and the piano practically lulls you into a meditative state while you watch. Is this fiber arts therapy for those of us who don't sew or knit or crochet? Maybe so. Whatever works, right?</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">- YouTube</small>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">\n            \n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay2SP9oi0Jc\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com</a>\n\n        </small>\n        </p><p>Kudos to those who are keeping these kinds of skills alive and sharing them with the world. We may not be passing this kind of knowledge down in most families anymore, but at least we have the internet to help us if we really want to learn it.</p><p><em>This article originally appeared three years ago.</em></p>",
