Working with small batches meant small sample sizes, and the statistical methods of his era simply didn't work well with limited data.</p>\n<p>Gosset's solution would transform not just brewing, but the entire scientific world. Through meticulous experimentation, including early Monte Carlo simulations using random numbers, he developed what became known as the t-test, a method for determining whether results from small samples represent genuine patterns or mere chance variation. The question \"Is this batch of hops truly defective, or did we just get unlucky with our samples?\" turned out to be fundamentally the same question researchers ask across medicine, psychology, agriculture, and countless other fields.</p>\n<p>Here's where the story gets delightfully peculiar: Guinness had prohibited employees from publishing research after a previous incident involving trade secrets. So Gosset published his groundbreaking 1908 paper under the pseudonym \"Student\" to avoid detection by his employer. This is why statistics textbooks still refer to \"Student's t-test\" rather than the Gosset t-test, a quirk of corporate secrecy that accidentally erased his name from his own achievement.</p>\n<p>The plaque, visible during Guinness Storehouse tours, recognizes this unlikely hero of modern science. Beneath his name and dates (1876–1937) appears his title \"Chief Brewer\" alongside \"Student 't' test\" a perfect encapsulation of how the pursuit of the perfect pint accidentally gave the world one of its most essential analytical tools. Brewers demand consistency while vintners celebrate variation, and in this case, that obsession with uniformity inspired genuine innovation.</p>\n<p>Gosset remained at Guinness throughout his career, eventually building a small statistics department and corresponding with luminaries like Ronald Fisher and Karl Pearson. He never sought fame for his discovery, content in the knowledge that he had solved real problems for his brewery while quietly revolutionizing how scientists everywhere interpret their data.</p>",

When you are put on the spot, and the adrenaline/heart rate/cortisol starts pumping, no resources go towards the part of your brain that helps you think clearly (prefrontal cortex). Instead, everything in your amygdala (the brains’ “alarm system,” as Giang put it) kicks in and causes you to treat the situation like a life-threatening event. So you freeze up the same way you might if you run into a grizzly bear.</p><p>On the other hand, you might go into “fight” mode, which in this case, looks a lot like rambling.

A special candle that smells just like your grandma's lotion, for example, or feeling sad can trigger memories of other times you were sad. </p><p>When a question is thrown at you, you don’t necessarily get one of these cues, and your brain scrambles for where to begin.</p><p>“It’s like digging through your backpack stuffed with loose papers. All the information is there, but with everyone watching and the clock ticking, you can't seem to find the right page so you fumble,” says Giang. </p><p>The biggest takeaway here isn’t that you don’t have the information you need to clearly express yourself, you just don’t have a system for organizing the plethora of information swirling around inside of you. And for that Giang suggested using the PREP (point, reason example, point) framework, which is as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Point:</strong> One main or opinion that kicks things off. </li><li><strong>Reason:</strong> Just one explanation as to why you hold that point or believe it is true, using justifications and evidence. </li><li><strong>Example:</strong> Data, a story, or concrete illustration to support your reasoning and make your point more persuasive. </li><li><strong>Point:</strong> Reiterating your original main point to reinforce your message and provide a strong conclusion.</li></ul><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">- YouTube</small>        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">                <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPoPGfoaoZo\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com</a>        </small>        </p><p>Not only this, but giving yourself a second to pause, breathe, and take in the question, repeating or reframing the question to yourself, and slowing down your speech as you answer can be incredibly helpful in clear, concise communication. </p><p>At the end of the day, blanking out doesn’t mean you’re unprepared or incapable. It's a sign your brain is working overtime. The good news is you only need a few simple adjustments to turn those high-pressure moments into opportunities for clarity.</p>",

From fragile, untouched ecosystems to familiar but unexplained occurrences in our own backyards, Untold Earth chases insight into natural phenomena through the voices of those who know them best.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Lucy Greeley: </strong>The closest thing I can think to imagining bioluminescence without it being bioluminescence are the stars. It's magical that in the sky you can see all these stars and then in the water you can see all these stars. I think that's what makes it so captivating for a lot of people.</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator: </strong>From Aristotle to Darwin, humankind's efforts to understand bioluminescence spans thousands of years. But even though it's one of the oldest fields of scientific study, the answers remain elusive. What is it about this inscrutable mystery that inspires such obsession?</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/106100/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p><strong>Rob Purser: </strong>Well, the history of Suquamish Tribe, we've been here for thousands of years. We had villages all through this immediate area over in the Hood Canal and on the Bremerton and all over Kitsap Peninsula.</p>\n<p><strong>Lucy: </strong>There isn't really that much known about bioluminescence in the Salish Sea. I think that's what makes it really special is a lot of people think about bioluminescence in these tropical regions, but we have it right up here in this very diverse and rich environment.</p>\n<p>I grew up in Seattle, Washington. I didn't really know that much about it. I went to one sleepaway camp and I remember getting woken up in the middle of the night. The counselors all pulled us campers down to the shore and started swimming in it. And we were like, what? That's crazy. And then I learned about this internship and I was like, that is perfect.</p>\n<p>So bioluminescence is a chemical reaction that occurs in a living organism in an oxygenated environment. If we think about plankton in general as a lot of tiny, really tiny microscopic free-floating organisms, within that there are a group of plankton called algae.</p>\n<p>Microscopic algae are split up into two different sectors, one of which is diatoms and then the other are dinoflagellates. And what I'm interested are dinoflagellates because some of these dinoflagellates are bioluminescent.</p>\n<p><strong>Carrley Smith: </strong>My name is Carrley. I've been guiding here. We're working here for about a month. And the cool thing about tonight and for the bioluminescence tours is we have Lucy here.</p>\n<p>I'm taking over her internship this summer with the hopes to keep doing it every summer so someone can come and keep following up on the research.</p>\n<p>We'll paddle out of the bay here. And then there's a cool little lagoon that we're going to go into. All right, Crystal, your rudder's coming down. You have steering. We'll see you out there.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/106096/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p>So they're not going to start bioluminescing until they know it's nighttime now. So the ones that we're seeing now are just the early risers. They just have their cup of coffee. They're just coming out. If we were out here at 2 a.m., more of them would be bioluminescing because they know it's nighttime because it's so energetically costly for them.</p>\n<p>They save it for when it's going to be good. Go paddle around. Some patches will be better than others. But play around, figure out a way that is really cool to see them and let us know. It's beautiful. Sparkle, sparkle.</p>\n<p>I don't think you can feel them, but it almost feels like you can. It makes it truly magic seeing it on your skin, on your fingers. It's so cool.</p>\n<p><strong>Lucy</strong>: We take samples as we're doing those tours and guiding people, and then we get to go back and do some lab work on it. The fun part about this research is sometimes it means that Carrley and I become a little nocturnal because we are trying to process some of these samples right as we get back.</p>\n<p>I was trying to identify some dinoflagellates that were present during the bioluminescent events and who could maybe be participating in that... Seems like more diatoms. That could be some sort of algae.</p>\n<p>And I found four known bioluminescent species that were in all my samples. There's research done that in the deep sea ocean where light can't penetrate, 90% of organisms can emit bioluminescence.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/106104/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p>There's such a common form of communication among this species and on this earth and that it's just something that's so hard for humans to study that we haven't thought that much about. That is exciting and that's fun to see and I think that that might even be one right next to it right there.</p>\n<p>Either one of them could be emitting bioluminescence. It's so fascinating how all of them are single-celled organisms. They don't seem like they're multifaceted and they don't seem like they're complicated, but yet they create this thing that's so special to see.</p>\n<p><strong>Dave Sigo: </strong>Fishing on the Salish Sea? Well, I love every part of it.</p>\n<p>It's our right. It's what we do. for our people. My grandfather, he traveled all over harvesting salmon, and my dad too. Trying to teach the youth how to carry on what we're doing here and preserve it. I know what's around here. You know, it's hard to catch salmon when that stuff lights up your neck because it's just like a big flashlight down there. I mean, a big wall of lights is what it looks like. And I always wondered what that stuff was about.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/106102/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p><strong>Lucy: </strong>Bioluminescent algae that we're concerned with, we're still kind of figuring out why they might be using it. The first of which is maybe that it's scaring or stunning a predator, the second that maybe it's attracting a secondary predator, and so then something eats the predator going after those bioluminescent algae.</p>\n<p>There's definitely an evolutionary advantage to it because so many different things have evolved the ability. These bioluminescent algae are very much at the bottom of the food chain and then that in turn can serve to produce a lot of oxygen in our environments. Little small fish will eat plankton and then bigger fish like salmon can eat those smaller fish and all the way up into marine mammals such as seals and our orcas.</p>\n<p>It's all interconnected and it's a really special environment. In the Salish Sea region, we don't actually know a lot about how these bioluminescent algae could be affecting the health of this ecosystem. And so I think that that's really important about what Carrley and I's research is tackling in that we are trying to answer these more basic questions that can hopefully provide an answer about whether more abundant bioluminescent algae is good or bad for this ecosystem, or whether or not it doesn't have an influence, or maybe it's just about having the right balance of these species.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/106103/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p>I think what drives me is the mystery of a lot of it. You can put on your goggles and your snorkel and swim in it and it's right in front of your eyes and it's so special to have something magical like that that you can really interact with. I think it plays into that same kind of childlike, explorative behavior in me.</p>\n<p>It's lovely.</p>",

Choose public or green transport:</span><span><br /></span><span></span></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Road transport contributes about 20% of PM2.5 <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/135087/mumbai-youngsters-manage-waste/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">emissions in Mumbai</a>. Taking a local train or metro twice a week instead of driving can cut your carbon footprint by up to 15% annually. Even one less car per home can make a difference.</span></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>2. Go easy on the industrial activities and vehicular emissions:</span><span><br /></span><span></span></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Vehicular emissions from petrol and diesel, along with industrial activities and port operations, result in elevated levels of PM2.5, with frequent daily averages exceeding 50&nbsp;</span><span>micrograms per cubic metre </span><span>according to Deccan Herald&rsquo;s report in January 2025.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Minimising the excessive use of diesel generators, we can cut localised emissions of soot, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter, helping improve air quality and reduce the overall pollution load in the city.</span></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>3. Plant local greens:</span><span><br /></span><span></span></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Native species like neem, ficus, and jamun can absorb 10&ndash;15 micrograms per cubic metre of PM2.5 per square metre of leaf area. Even <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/134668/maharashtra-plastic-ban/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">balcony plants</a> make a measurable difference in micro-environments.</span></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>4. Celebrate consciously:</span><span><br /></span><span></span></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Firecrackers give a sharp, short-term boost to PM 2.5 &mdash; in Mumbai, recent reports showed citywide PM 2.5 rose by roughly 30 &ndash; 40% on Diwali nights.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>With strict enforcement, designated bursting zones and public awareness, short-term festival peaks in PM2.5 levels could plausibly be reduced, and there can be brighter and healthier celebrations.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>These small actions that we take together can lead to big changes.

But her extraordinary achievements leave a profound legacy.</p>\n<figure>\n            <p>\n                    <img alt=\"Jane-goodall-chimp_2025-10-02.jpg\" src=\"https://www.earthtouchnews.com/media/1955766/jane-goodall-chimp_2025-10-02.jpg?mode=crop&amp;width=1060&amp;height=707\" />\n                <br /><figcaption>Image © Penelope Breese/Getty</figcaption>\n            </p>\n        </figure>\n<p>Goodall was a world-leading expert in animal behaviour and a globally recognised environmental and conservation advocate. She achieved all this at a time when women were commonly sidelined or ignored in science.</p>\n<p>Her work with chimpanzees showed it was wrong to assume only humans used tools. She showed us the animals expressed emotions such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQNmOYydlKE\">love and grief</a> and have individual personalities.</p>\n<p>Goodall showed us scientists <em>can</em> express their emotions and values and that we <em>can</em> be respected researchers as well as passionate advocates and science communicators. After learning about how chimpanzees were being used in medical research, she <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/business/jane-goodall-corner-office.html\">spoke out</a>: “I went to the conference as a scientist, and I left as an activist.”</p>\n<p>As childhood rights activist Marian Wright Edelman has eloquently <a href=\"https://unitar.org/about/news-stories/stories/you-cant-be-what-you-cant-see\">put it</a>, “You can’t be what you can’t see”.</p>\n<p>Goodall showed what it was possible to be.</p>\n<h6>Forging her own path</h6>\n<p>Goodall took a nontraditional path into science. The brave step of going into the field at <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-10-02/primatologist-jane-goodall-obituary/102197696\">the age of 26</a> to make observations was supported by her mother.</p>\n<p>Despite making world-first discoveries such as tool use by non-humans, people didn’t take her seriously because she hadn’t yet <a href=\"https://time.com/3949985/jane-goodall-college-history/\">gone to university</a>. Nowadays, people who contribute wildlife observations are celebrated under the banner of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/social-media-footage-reveals-little-known-surfing-whales-in-australian-waters-241347\">citizen science</a>.</p>\n<p>Goodall was a beacon at a time when science was largely dominated by men – especially remote fieldwork. But she changed that narrative. She convinced famous paleoanthropologist <a href=\"https://leakeyfoundation.org/about-us/the-leakey-family/\">Louis Leakey</a> to give her a chance. He first employed her as a secretary. But it wasn’t long until he asked her <a href=\"https://janegoodall.global/rememberingjane/\">to go to Tanzania’s remote Gombe Stream National Park</a>. In 1960, she arrived.</p>\n<p>This was not easy. It took real courage to work in a remote area with limited support alongside chimpanzees, a species thought to be peaceful but now known to be far stronger than humans and capable of killing animals and humans.</p>\n<p>Goodall is believed to be the only person <a href=\"https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/jane-goodall/\">accepted into chimpanzee society</a>. Through <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2025/10/jane-goodall-1934-2025-primatologist-conservationist-and-messenger-of-hope/\">calm but determined persistence</a> she won their trust. These qualities served Goodall well – not just with chimps, but throughout her entire career advocating for conservation and societal change.</p>\n<p>At Gombe, she showed for the first time that animals could fashion and use tools, had individual personalities, expressed emotions and had a <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/jane-goodall-conservationist-who-transformed-our-understanding-of/\">higher intelligence and understanding</a> than they were credited with.</p>\n<div class=\"videoWrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; margin: 20px 0;\">\n        <!-- Copy & Pasted from YouTube -->\n        \n    </div>\n<p>Goodall was always an animal person and her love of chimps was in part inspired by her toy Jubilee, gifted by her father. She had close bonds with her pets and extended these bonds to wildlife. Goodall gave her study subjects names such as “<a href=\"https://www.news.janegoodall.org/2015/09/29/the-famous-chimps-of-gombe/2/\">David Greybeard</a>”, the first chimp to accept her at Gombe.</p>\n<p>Some argue we shouldn’t place a <a href=\"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pan3.10503\">human persona on animals</a> by naming them. But Goodall showed it was not only acceptable to see animals as individuals with different behaviours, but it greatly aids connection with and care for wildlife.</p>\n<p>Goodall became an international voice for wildlife. She used her profile to encourage a focus on animal welfare in conservation, caring for both individuals and species.  </p>\n<figure>\n            <p>\n                    <img alt=\"Jane-goodall-baby-chimp_2025-10-02.jpg\" src=\"https://www.earthtouchnews.com/media/1955764/jane-goodall-baby-chimp_2025-10-02.jpg?mode=crop&amp;width=1060&amp;height=707\" />\n                <br /><figcaption>Jane Goodall’s pioneering work with chimpanzees shed light on these animals as individuals – and showed they make tools and experience emotions.

The other two are the naturalist documentary maker, Sir David Attenborough, 99, and famed marine biologist Dr Sylvia Earle, who is 90.</p>\n<p>Goodall showed us women can be pioneering scientists and renowned communicators as well as mothers.</p>\n<p>She shared her work in ways accessible to all generations, from National Geographic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3b6zSpy7P4\">documentaries</a> to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4cGn-gm4MTI?si=mMQp_Asv1ggTYM27\">hip podcasts</a>.</p>\n<p>Her visibility encouraged girls and women around the world to be bold and follow our own paths.  </p>\n<p>Goodall’s story directly inspired several authors of this article.</p>\n<p>Co-author Marissa Parrott was privileged to have spoken to Goodall several times during her <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/protect-primates-to-salve-planet-urges-jane-goodall-20110609-1fuwp.html\">visits</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcMcGDgrA74\">Melbourne Zoo</a> and on her world tours. Goodall’s story was a direct inspiration for Parrott’s own remote and international fieldwork, supported by her mother just as Goodall’s mother had <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-10-02/primatologist-jane-goodall-obituary/102197696\">supported her</a>. They both survived <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-catching-malaria-gave-me-a-new-perspective-on-saving-gorillas-103911\">malaria</a>, which also kills chimpanzees and gorillas. Goodall long championed a <a href=\"https://news.janegoodall.org/2021/02/23/zoonotic-disease-one-health-and-jgi-everything-is-connected/\">One Health</a> approach, recognising the health of communities, wildlife and the environment are all interconnected.</p>\n<p>Co-author Zara Bending worked and toured alongside Goodall. The experience demonstrated how conservationists could be powerful advocates through storytelling, and how our actions reveal who we are. As Goodall once said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>every single one of us matters, every single one of us has a role to play, and every single one of us makes a difference every single day.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h6>From the forest floor to global icon</h6>\n<p>Goodall knew conservation is as much about people as it is about wildlife and wild places.</p>\n<p>Seventeen years after beginning her groundbreaking research in Gombe, Goodall established the <a href=\"https://janegoodall.global/\">Jane Goodall Institute</a> with the mission of protecting wildlife and habitat by engaging local communities.</p>\n<p>Her institute’s <a href=\"https://janegoodall.global/\">global network</a> now spans five continents and continues her legacy of <a href=\"https://www.esri.com/about/newsroom/blog/goodall-tacare-human-wildlife-relationship\">community-centred conservation</a>. Researchers have now been studying the chimps at Gombe for <a href=\"https://news.janegoodall.org/2025/07/08/gombe-chimpanzee-research-65-year/\">65 years</a>.</p>\n<p>Goodall moved from fieldwork to being a global conservation icon who regularly travelled more than 300 days a year. She observed many young people across cultures and creeds who had lost hope for their future amid environmental and climate destruction. In response, she founded a second organisation, <a href=\"https://rootsandshoots.global/\">Roots &amp; Shoots</a>, in 1991. Her goal was:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>to foster respect and compassion for all living things, to promote understanding of all cultures and beliefs, and to inspire each individual to take action to make the world a better place for people, other animals, and the environment.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Last year, Roots &amp; Shoots groups were active in 75 countries. Their work is a testament to Goodall’s mantra: find hope in action.</p>\n<figure>\n            <p>\n                    <img alt=\"Jane-goodall-speaking_2025-10-02.jpg\" src=\"https://www.earthtouchnews.com/media/1955765/jane-goodall-speaking_2025-10-02.jpg?mode=crop&amp;width=1060&amp;height=707\" />\n                <br /><figcaption>Jane Goodall went from pioneering field researcher to international conservation icon.

Holloway/Getty</a></figcaption>\n            </p>\n        </figure>\n<h6>Protecting nature close to home</h6>\n<p>One of Goodall’s most remarkable attributes was her drive to give people the power to take action where they were. No matter where people lived or what they did, she helped them realise they could be part of the solution.</p>\n<p>In a busy, urbanised world, it’s easier than ever to feel disconnected from nature. Rather than presenting nature as a distant concept, Goodall made it something for everyone to experience, care for and cherish.</p>\n<p>She showed we didn’t have to leave our normal lives behind to protect nature – we could make just as much difference in our own communities.</p>\n<p>One of her most famous quotes rings just as true today as when she first said it:  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>only if we understand, can we care. Only if we care, will we help. Only if we help shall all be saved.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let’s honour her world-changing legacy by committing to understand, care and help save all species with whom we share this world.

In fact, our new study, <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1007/s44338-025-00099-2\">published today</a> in Discover Animals, shows interspecies interactions between dolphins and whales are widespread and frequent around the world.</p>\n<figure>\n            <p>\n                    <img alt=\"whale-swimming_2025-08-21.jpg\" src=\"https://www.earthtouchnews.com/media/1955741/whale-swimming_2025-08-21.jpg?mode=crop&amp;width=1060&amp;height=707\" />\n                <br /><figcaption>Image © drewsulockcreations/Getty</figcaption>\n            </p>\n        </figure>\n<h6>An astonishing interaction</h6>\n<p>There have been several reports of whale and dolphin interaction in the past.</p>\n<p>One that astonished the public back in 2004 featured a humpback whale in Hawaii repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC3AkGSigrA\">lifting a bottlenose dolphin on its head</a>.</p>\n<p>Researchers suggested <a href=\"https://www.aquaticmammalsjournal.org/article/vol-36-iss-2-deakos-et-al/\">such close contact between whales and dolphins</a> is likely very rare – and maybe related to care giving.</p>\n<p>But other forms of interactions resembling joint feeding, play and harassment are now being frequently documented thanks to drone technology. Many are also featured on social media.</p>\n<div class=\"videoWrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; margin: 20px 0;\">\n        <!-- Copy & Pasted from YouTube -->\n        \n    </div>\n<h6>A ‘whale’s-eye view’ of the world</h6>\n<p>For our new study, we undertook an analysis of 199 independent whale-dolphin interaction events involving 19 different species. These interactions spanned two decades and occurred across 17 countries.</p>\n<p>We drew from social media platforms – such as Facebook, YouTube and Instagram – and footage contributed by citizens to get a variety of observations.</p>\n<p>Each entry was carefully reviewed to identify the species involved, validate the interaction and categorise behaviours. Two additional cases came from camera tags attached to humpback whales. These offered an underwater “whale’s-eye view” of their encounters with dolphins.</p>\n<p>We categorised behaviours such as rolling, tail slaps, bow riding, and rubbing, and classified dolphin positions relative to whale body parts such as head, flank and tail fluke.</p>\n<h6>Having fun or fighting?</h6>\n<p>The study contradicted earlier assumptions that interspecies interactions between dolphins and whales are very rare.</p>\n<p>The most common interaction was dolphins swimming near the whale’s head (akin to bow riding). This accounted for 80% of observed dolphin positions. Humpback whales were the most involved whale species, while bottlenose dolphins led the dolphin side.</p>\n<p>Based on videos we analysed, dolphins initiated most interactions through bow riding, swimming in formation, or even touching whales.</p>\n<p>In more than one-quarter of the events, the whales responded in seemingly similar ways. For example, humpback whales often rolled, exposed their bellies, or gently turned toward dolphins.</p>\n<p>Tail slaps and other signs of distress or aggression were rare (roughly 5% of cases).</p>\n<p>As a result of this, we classified more than one-third of all interactions between humpback whales and dolphins as positive or possible social play.</p>\n<p>The two camera-tag videos revealed previously undocumented interaction. Dolphins were observed following humpback whales not only at the surface but down to the ocean floor. They maintained eye contact or even touched the whales’ head – suggesting intentional, possibly social, engagement.</p>\n<div class=\"videoWrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; margin: 20px 0;\">\n        <!-- Copy & Pasted from YouTube -->\n        \n    </div>\n<h6>Reflecting advanced emotional capabilities</h6>\n<p>The findings reshape our understanding of how social marine mammals interact across species. They suggest interspecies interaction among marine mammals may be far more prevalent and complex than previously believed.</p>\n<p>Dolphins may seek out whales as companions for stimulation, play or even courtship-like behaviour. Meanwhile, certain whale species, particularly humpback whales, may not only tolerate but also engage with dolphins in a social capacity.</p>\n<p>This interspecies dynamic adds a new dimension to marine mammal social ecology and could point to cultural elements in whale and dolphin societies. The playfulness, cooperation and apparent enjoyment observed in many interactions reflect advanced cognitive and emotional capabilities.</p>\n<p>The study also demonstrates the power of new technologies and community science. Social media and drones proved invaluable for collecting a range of diverse behavioural data that traditional surveys might miss.</p>\n<p>Social media data has limitations, such as geographic and observer bias caused by different angles, heights, equipment and frequency of use of social media. But it does complement other data and helps uncover previously unknown behaviours.</p>\n<p>Whales and dolphins don’t just coexist but also seek each other out. Future studies incorporating acoustic recordings and longer observation periods could further unravel the motivations and meanings behind these fascinating encounters.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

      "link": "https://www.earthtouchnews.com/natural-world/natural-world/watch-canada-lynx-puts-on-a-show-in-a-minnesotan-backyard",
      "summary": "<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Few North American mammals are so phantasmal as the Canada lynx, a grey ghost of a hunter primarily found in the continent’s sprawling boreal forest. Getting a good look at these normally ultra-elusive wildcats makes for a red-letter day. One such day just transpired in Minnesota, USA, along the extreme southern fringes of that taiga realm.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarah Hamilton, the owner of the Trail Center Lodge in Grand Marais, <span><a href=\"https://www.aol.com/watch-lodge-owner-captures-close-155918362.html\" target=\"_blank\">filmed a lynx</a></span> pacing along the property’s snowy deck on February 23rd. It’s a strikingly up-close and extended view of a carnivore rarely spied at all in the state. A dog inside certainly seems plenty excited by the sighting, its barks at one point in the footage causing the lynx to cast a bit of side-eye. (Back in 2020, an even rarer observation—a <span><a href=\"https://www.earthtouchnews.com/discoveries/discoveries/black-lynx-spotted-in-canada-and-theres-footage-to-prove-it/\">black, aka melanistic, lynx in Yukon, Canada</a></span>—inspired a similar uproar from a pooch.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Trail Center Lodge lies along the Gunflint Trail, a historic highway set in the Border Lakes ecoregion of far northeastern Minnesota near the state’s border with Ontario (and the expansive <span><a href=\"https://wilderness.net/visit-wilderness/?ID=70\">Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness</a></span>). This corner of the state has produced the <span><a href=\"https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/nhnrp/lynx_sightings.html\">majority of recent lynx sightings in Minnesota</a></span>.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The great bulk of that boreal forest lapping down into Minnesota and some other northerly parts of the lower 48 U.S. states lies in Canada and Alaska, and that’s also where most of Canada’s lynx reside. Studies suggest Minnesota harbours a <span><a href=\"https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/rsg/profile.html?action=elementDetail&amp;selectedElement=AMAJH03010\">small, low-density breeding population of lynx</a></span> as well as Canadian wanderers coming down from the north, their patterns more tied to the boom-and-bust population cycles of the snowshoe hare, the wildcat’s preferred prey. (The outsized paws of the Canada lynx allow it to float over the snowpack: a valuable adaptation when <span><a href=\"https://www.earthtouchnews.com/natural-world/predator-vs-prey/lynx-family-of-six-chases-a-hare-in-rare-sighting-video/\">pursuing the similarly endowed hare</a></span> through the boreal woods, where Old Man Winter holds court for a big chunk of the year.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Protected in Minnesota since 1984, the Canada lynx in the “Lower 48” is a federally threatened species. Another member of the lynx genus, the bobcat, is vastly more numerous in Minnesota, vastly more widespread in the conterminous US, and a textbook generalist sort of carnivore compared to its heavily (<span><a href=\"https://www.earthtouchnews.com/natural-world/predator-vs-prey/lynx-chases-squirrel-up-a-tree-plan-quickly-backfires/\">though not exclusively</a></span>) hare-focused cousin. It also seems more tolerant of human activity and development (case in point: <span><a href=\"https://www.earthtouchnews.com/in-the-field/backyard-wildlife/city-bobcat-nabs-squirrel-scampers-down-a-storm-drain/\">hauling urban squirrels down into storm drains</a></span>).</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stubbier, comparatively small-footed bobcat looks smaller than the lanky and lithe Canada lynx, but in fact these two medium-sized wildcats overlap significantly in the weight department. Generally speaking, the bobcat, which can thrive everywhere from hardwood forests and swamps to prairies and deserts, seems to essentially “take over” for the Canada lynx south of the taiga (though in western North America the latter does haunt a modest range southward into the high-elevation conifer forests of the U.S. Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest, also bobcat country). Some evidence suggests that potential climate-change impacts on snow cover and depth regimes<span><a href=\"https://www.facetsjournal.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/facets-2019-0019\"> might allow bobcats to invade northward</a></span> at the expense of the grey ghost.</p>\n<hr class=\"related-link\" />\n    <div class=\"related-more\">\n        <span>\n            Read more:\n            <a href=\"https://www.earthtouchnews.com/natural-world/animal-behaviour/nimble-arizona-bobcat-scales-a-tall-saguaro-cactus\">\n\t\t\tNimble Arizona bobcat scales a tall saguaro cactus\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</a>\n        </span>\n    </div>\n    <hr class=\"related-link\" />\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s worth acknowledging that Minnesota has a third—and much heftier—native felid: the cougar or puma, extirpated from the state during the early phase of Euro-American settlement, but <span><a href=\"https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/mammals/cougar/index.html\">increasingly showing up</a></span> in these old haunts of theirs.

He came back inside.</p><p>“Do you need some money?” he asked.</p><p>Crawley said no, that he just couldn’t remember his code, and it was okay. The man said it was fine, and then walked around to the register. When Crawley realized what he was doing, he insisted it was okay; he had the money but just needed to figure out his PIN.</p><p>“It’s a free country, isn’t it?” the stranger asked. “I can help a brother out, can’t I?”</p><p>Crawley was stunned. The bill was $110, but eventually, he accepted the <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/kindness-quotes/\">kind</a> man’s help.

Then the man left. </p><p>“I turned around to the attendant and she said, ‘Well that doesn’t happen every day,’” Crawley recalled. “I turned around to leave, and he was gone, literally gone.

Helping each other out when times are tough, even when we don’t know the person, is what makes us human, and what can make this life so beautiful.</p><p>So the next time you’re in a position to pay it forward, why not? Go ahead and buy that coffee for the person behind you. Pay that parking meter that’s about to expire for a total stranger.

Visitors can explore the collection, along with bus artifacts and memorabilia, on guided one-hour tours.</p>\n<p>The museum regularly rents out its buses to production companies. You can recreate the <em>Forrest Gump</em> scene in which Jenny looks out to Forrest out the back window of a 1959 GM TDM 4515 bus and flashes a peace sign, or hop aboard the loaned 1929 Yellow Coach that served as transportation for John Walton Sr.’s trip home for Christmas in <em>The Waltons: Homecoming</em>. </p>\n<p>The museum also sponsors historic bus excursions where the routes of a particular bus system are retraced, usually aboard a vintage bus.</p>\n<p>Volunteer bus mechanics, archivists and bus fans will all like this family-friendly museum.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>I love FM radio. It’s okay: You can call me a Luddite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My alarm clock is the local public radio station. I love toggling between a few music stations while driving, or even while reading at home. And during a road trip, there’s nothing quite like discovering a community station with random locals curating their own playlists—it gives you a sense of where you are that no Spotify playlist can match.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem: It’s hard to know what stations exist locally, even in your own town but particularly while on a road trip. You can explore the dial, which has a certain serendipity, but what if you just want to . . . know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>And </em>be able to tune in with or without an actual traditional radio in front of you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This tip originally appeared in the free </em><a href=\"https://theintelligence.com/cool-tools-fc\"><strong><em>Cool Tools newsletter</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong><em>from </em><a href=\"http://theintelligence.com/\"><em>The Intelligence</em></a><em>.

It’s a free website that lets you enter any city or zip code and find all the terrestrial stations that are available for that area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>➜ It’ll show you a list of every FM <em>and </em>AM station in any U.S. city or zip code. You can also browse international radio stations by country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>⌚ And it all takes just a few seconds<strong> </strong>to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91437873\" height=\"464\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/11/radio-locator.png\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The Radio Locator site is free and as simple as can be.<br /></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a rare service that isn’t cluttered with ads or upselling. Just open the site, type a place, and you’ll see a list. Stations are sorted by frequency, but you’ll also see the call sign, the distance to the tower, and what format of radio station is offered. (I’m personally always looking for public radio or alternative stations, but you can figure out what <em>you </em>want for yourself.)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91437876\" height=\"472\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/11/radio-locator-stations.png\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">You can find info about all sorts of stations, in any geographical area.<br /></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>📲 Of course, all of this only applies if you’ve got an actual-factual FM radio on your hands. What if you’re more of a computer-and-phone kind of person? Easy: Just click through on any of the stations on Radio Locator, and they’ll generally take you to a website where you can stream the station.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>💡 Or, if you prefer a dedicated tool for the job, there’s <a href=\"https://streema.com/\"><strong>​</strong>Streema<strong>​</strong></a>. It’s a free site that makes it easy to search for and stream just about any radio station imaginable, anywhere in the world. A few stations redirect to websites—best I can tell for legal reasons—but the overwhelming majority of the time, you can just search for a website and start listening.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91437877\" height=\"434\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/11/streema.png\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Streema makes most on-demand radio listening a swift click or tap away.<br /></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, you can find and listen to old-fashioned radio stations anytime. Again: I recommend finding public and community stations, as those tend not to have ads, but take the time to explore. It’s nice to get away from the algorithm sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You can open <a href=\"https://radio-locator.com/\">Radio Locator​</a> and <a href=\"https://streema.com/\">​Streema​</a> directly in your web browser on any device.

      "summary": "<p>Two months ago, Apple released iOS 26 for the iPhone. The new operating system includes <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91396318/ios-26-iphone-apple-productivity-hacks-live-translation-call-screening-hold-calendar-events-custom-folder\">several productivity</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91371990/ios-26-new-features-beta-liquid-glass-messages-poll-passport-travel-hold-assist-onscreen-awareness-visual-intelligence-flight-information-wallet\">other enhancements</a>, but the main feature is a new <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91349477/apples-liquid-glass-is-exactly-as-ambitious-as-apple\">design language</a> called Liquid Glass. The flat, minimalist look of iOS that lasted for more than a decade is gone, replaced by a transparent interface of toolbars and buttons that mimic how light bends and warps as it passes through glass.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who appreciate the new look of iOS often praise Liquid Glass as refreshing and unique, saying it gives the iPhone’s software a sense of fluidity that other touch interfaces lack. Others argue that Liquid Glass’s transparent elements make the device harder to use, as the content behind iOS 26’s buttons and toolbars often obscures the symbols or text that label the interface elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you fall into the latter group, there’s some good news. Apple is increasingly providing options to tone down the most controversial aspects of the Liquid Glass design. Here they are:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-option-1-turn-on-the-tint\">Option #1: Turn on the tint</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This week, Apple released its first major update to iOS 26: iOS 26.1. This<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26_1-release-notes/\">update fixed numerous bugs</a> while also adding new features; it expanded Apple Intelligence and AirPods Live Translation features to new countries, added new swipe controls to the Music app, and overhauled the alarm clock interface so you don’t accidentally tap “snooze” and miss your meeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91437573\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/11/LG-CT.png\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The new “clear” (left) and ”tinted” (right) options for Liquid Glass.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But<span style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">&nbsp;as&nbsp;<em>Fast Company</em>&nbsp;previously reported,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91425930/hate-iphone-liquid-glass-download-apple-ios-26-1-beta-4\" target=\"_blank\">iOS 26.1’s best new feature</a>&nbsp;is a toggle that lets users tone down Liquid Glass&#8217;s design</span>. It does this by allowing users to choose between two different Liquid Glass interfaces.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The “Clear” interface is the default Liquid Glass, with interface element transparency at a maximum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The “Tinted” interface option reduces this default transparency to give Liquid Glass elements a more frosted look. This can greatly improve the readability of button and toolbar labels by increasing their contrast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turning on the Liquid Glass tint is easy, as long as you have iOS 26.1 installed on your iPhone:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Open the Settings app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap Display and Brightness.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap Liquid Glass.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap the “Tinted” option.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see from the screenshots above, the &#8220;tinted&#8221; Liquid Glass option brings a frosted look (right) to the default transparency (left).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-option-2-increase-the-contrast\">Option #2: Increase the contrast</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re still on iOS 26.0 or just want to eliminate the default look of Liquid Glass even more on your iPhone that&#8217;s running iOS 26.1, you can tone down Liquid Glass in three other ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91437575\" height=\"404\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/11/LG-IC.png\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The default look of Liquid Glass (left) versus Liquid Glass with the “Increase Contrast” Accessibility option enabled (right)<strong><em>.</em></strong></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first is by enabling the “Increase Contrast” Accessibility option on your iPhone. This feature is designed for users with sight issues, but anyone can enable it, and many have found that doing so makes Liquid Glass more palatable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Apple notes, enabling this setting helps “Increase color contrast between app foreground and background colors.” Here’s how you turn it on:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Open the Settings app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap Accessibility.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap Display &amp; Text Size.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Toggle the “Increase Contrast” switch to ON (green).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see in the screenshots above, enabling the “Increase Contrast” option (right) adds a slight outline around interface borders and adds a grey smokiness to transparent elements, which makes text and buttons easier to see than they are in the default Liquid Glass design (left).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-option-3-reduce-the-transparency\">Option #3: Reduce the transparency</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A third way to tone down Liquid Glass is to enable another Accessibility option on your iPhone called “Reduce Transparency.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91437576\" height=\"402\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/11/LG-RT.png\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The default look of Liquid Glass (left) versus Liquid Glass with the “Reduce Transparency” Accessibility option enabled (right).</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This option tones Liquid Glass down even further than the “Increase Contrast” option, greatly reducing its transparency. As Apple notes, this option helps “Improve contrast by reducing transparency and blurs on some backgrounds to increase legibility.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To enable the setting:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Open the Settings app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap Accessibility.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap Display &amp; Text Size.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Toggle the “Reduce Transparency” switch to ON (green).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see in the screenshot above, enabling the “Reduce Transparency” option (right) virtually blocks any background content from bleeding through buttons and toolbar elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-option-4-outline-buttons-for-easier-visibility\">Option #4: Outline buttons for easier visibility</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A final way to tone down Liquid Glass is to force iOS 26.1 to show borders around buttons and other UI elements. This is done via the &#8220;Show Borders&#8221; Accessibility option.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91437579\" height=\"188\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/11/i-LG-SB.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Enabling &#8220;Show Borders&#8221; (right) can help make some buttons easier to see in Liquid Glass.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This option forces outlines to appear around &#8220;prominent UI,&#8221; according to Apple&#8217;s iOS 26.1 notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To enable the setting:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Open the Settings app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap Accessibility.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap Display &amp; Text Size.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Toggle the “Show Borders” switch to ON (green).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see in the screenshot above, enabling this option displays a thin outline around buttons and other UI elements, helping them stand out more on your screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-liquid-glass-isn-t-going-away\">Liquid Glass isn’t going away</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new look of iOS 26 isn’t temporary—nor should it be. While there have been some vocal detractors to the new design, a large majority of iPhone users seem to love the refreshed look. After Apple spent years developing that new design, there’s no way they would go back to the old one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Apple’s addition of a new “tint” option for Liquid Glass via a dedicated control in the iOS 26.1 Settings app shows that the company is listening to feedback from all its users and is not averse to giving individuals more control over how Liquid Glass looks to them. So, while you may not be able to turn off Liquid Glass, you now at least have three ways to tone it down.</p>",

But our generation grew up with the reality of climate change, animal extinction, and severe air and <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/201010/india-water-pollution-cleaning-complaints-robot-hair-innovation-hair-technology/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">water pollution</a>. Since I was about six years old and learned about these things on National Geographic, this discomfort about a bleak future has stayed with me,&rdquo; explains Angad, in a conversation with <strong>The Better India</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Solving real-world problems has always excited him. A child prodigy from Mumbai, Angad built his first robot and a solar-powered boat at age 8, besides building a homegrown <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/303783/chennai-startup-avay-biosciences-builds-bio-3d-printer-to-print-human-tissues/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">3D printer</a> by 13 and an e-reader (Virtual Brailler) for the visually-challenged by 15. He briefly dropped out of the schooling system because of his disillusionment with the rote learning-based state board system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I found school confusing. While I was doing well academically, the rote-based education didn&rsquo;t build my fundamentals which would become obvious when I&rsquo;d compete in Olympiads and struggle to solve problems. At the same time as a hobby, I was building all these complex engineering projects at home on my own simply by watching videos or reading books. When I dropped out of school, my parents hired a tutor who would teach me all the same things as other high school students, while rebuilding my fundamentals. Since I didn&rsquo;t have homework and was solving problems while learning the topics, I had a lot of free time to focus on my scientific hobbies.&rdquo; he recalls.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During this time, when Angad was around 14 years old, he wrote an email to<a href=\"https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/elevateprize/solutions/29235\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Professor Ramesh Raskar</a>, an Indian-born professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Currently, he&rsquo;s an Associate Professor of media arts and sciences at the renowned MIT Media Lab and an advisor to renowned technology giants like Google and Apple.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amusing looking back at my ignorance, but I wrote to him saying, &lsquo;You are an Indian professor and MIT brings bright young students from around the world to its campus, so why not bring on someone from India?&rsquo; Incredibly, he wrote back almost immediately and I ended up working with MIT via their India Initiative for two years building technology that could solve real-world problems in health tech. Even till this day,<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1204696763436090\"> Professor Raskar</a> remains supportive of my journey and has been an incredible mentor&rdquo; he recalls.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After those two years working with MIT, he went back to an IB (International Baccalaureate) school, following which he studied electrical engineering at the prestigious Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech). It was during his time in college when he decided to act on the growing problem of air pollution and began developing solutions for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Today, his startup has built one of the &ldquo;world&rsquo;s most advanced air purification technologies&rdquo; using a unique combination of electrical charge dispersion and airflow optimization-based processes - allowing particles to be charged and creating electric fields that move the particles to a collection chamber. Angad combined his background in electrical engineering, product design, IoT, process engineering, and manufacturing to create a whole new class of air purifiers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In short, his solution works through a network of air purifying units that can clean air within large spaces like factory floors in just minutes by mapping how the pollution is flowing on the shop floor and then strategically placing the air purifiers to capture that pollution. For example, Praan's latest product called the MK II (&lsquo;Mach 2&rsquo;) has a high purification rate of 1300 cubic feet per minute.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"The MK II \" class=\"wp-image-338473\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/post_attachments/uploads/2024/01/Praan.io-Image-3-1705505138.jpg\" /><br />\n<figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The MK II</figcaption>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-inspired-by-illness-nbsp\">Inspired by illness&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Growing up in Mumbai, Angad suffered from asthma. Every winter, particularly during the festive season, he would endure breathing difficulties due to high air pollution and his family would have to leave the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;With asthma and high dust levels in the city, I would struggle to play football. I couldn&rsquo;t run properly because my stamina would take a hit and I would cough constantly. But this was a reality for a lot of people living around me. Today, while I can move to a country with a cleaner environment, I can&rsquo;t expect my family and friends to do the same. I couldn&rsquo;t see them breathe this toxic air every day and this is why finding a solution was so important to me,&rdquo; recalls Angad.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In 2017, just before he began his sophomore year at Georgia Tech, he began working on solutions for urban air pollution but this came with some real challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If I used Georgia Tech&rsquo;s infrastructure to build my solution, as per the clauses, they would own all the intellectual property. As a result, I wouldn&rsquo;t have the freedom to commercialise it as per evolving requirements. And hence, commercially, we didn't have access to any of their labs. Also, as a result of my visa status, I legally could not register a company and start a business with a co-founder there while being a college student,&rdquo; he recalls.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;And the truth about building air purification technology is that it's not just the purifier or the sensor you're building, but you're also building the infrastructure to test it in different wind, temperature, humidity, and pollution conditions. Given the lack of financial resources during the bootstrap phase, it was pretty hard to build a safe test chamber that could work in all these different conditions, provide accurate and reliable data and allow you to test with all different materials of dust, gases and pollutants,&rdquo; adds Angad.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a result, Angad started building the prototypes of these filterless purification systems based on physics principles out of his apartment room near Georgia Tech where basic characteristics could be inspected visually.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to<a href=\"https://praan.io/news/praans-story/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> this detailed description</a> on Praan&rsquo;s website, &ldquo;He would carry the prototype for 2 miles several times every week from his apartment to the on-campus makerspace to build the earliest versions of a filterless air purification system. The device first started with a paint-bucket prototype and then made it to a steel ducting system version.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As he continued to work on it, more and more students around campus would find him walking across the lawn with this 5ft-tall metal structure which looked like a jet engine. Out of curiosity, they would talk to him,&rdquo; it adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A couple of weeks later, however, CNN reached out to him to interview for their &lsquo;Tomorrow&rsquo;s Hero&rsquo; series. Following discussions over email, they came down to the Georgia Tech campus and shot a video with him where they discussed his mission, approach and the technology he was building to address urban air pollution. CNN eventually recorded and published this article and<a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/videos/tv/2018/03/27/tomorrows-hero-angad-daryani.cnn\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> video</a> which went viral in no time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to note, however, that Angad wasn&rsquo;t initially interested in building your conventional indoor air purifiers that you can install at home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Despite the commercial appeal, I resisted developing a conventional indoor air purifying system. I was not thinking about the top 1% who can afford a Dyson but that child who walks to school every day or a factory worker breathing in toxic air during his/her shifts. My objective was to find something that can be done for large spaces,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Another important facet was not to involve filters. If I keep a filter-based air purifier at a large space in Delhi during the winter one would have to change the filter every hour. I wanted to build a filterless system, which means no recurring cost of ownership in these large spaces,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Angad Daryani with an MK II at a factory floor.\" class=\"wp-image-338472\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/post_attachments/uploads/2024/01/Praan.io-Image-1-1705504986.jpg\" /><br />\n<figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Angad Daryani with an MK II at a factory floor</figcaption>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-power-of-volunteers\">Power of volunteers</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A couple of months after his appearance on CNN, Angad returned to India for the summer where he continued to work on prototyping the devices and testing them in India.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As<a href=\"https://praan.io/news/praans-story/\"> the Praan website</a> notes, &ldquo;Since this project was entirely bootstrapped with no external financing, all the prototyping was done with off-the-shelf components and built-in Angad&rsquo;s bedroom and terrace in Mumbai, each prototype was hand built, cut, glued, soldered, and tested outdoors. During this process, he kept posting pictures of his progress on the internet.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The explanation goes on to add, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/246668/energy-saving-building-management-system-bios-enlite-research-garima-bharadwaj-gaurav-bali-yos191/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Deeptech</a> was still new in India and hence the availability of risk capital was bleak. So Angad had to bootstrap the project and saw 30 more volunteers join him in his mission as he returned to Atlanta in the Fall 2018. This team was fundamentally trying to figure out if filterless air purification using cold plasma technology was possible and was alternatively also experimenting with bioengineering techniques for purifying air in cities.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Since his team didn&rsquo;t have an office or access to capital, all experimenting of the core tech was done in public parking lots or park benches in Atlanta during after-hours or on weekends. After a couple of months, Angad and his team of over 30 volunteers developed the first prototypes for filterless air purification devices and learned how to design test rigs for building these systems - a process they say they continue to invent and learn from even today, 6 years later.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This was also the time when the project got the name &lsquo;Praan&rsquo;. During this time, Angad and a few members of the team even reached out to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in India to propose a filterless approach to outdoor air purification. Following this, in December 2018, they flew to New Delhi and demonstrated the concept for their first prototype.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Soon after this, the conversations around Praan&rsquo;s mission grew within the Georgia Tech and Emory University Campuses, leading to many more people applying to join the team of volunteers working on this mission. In a fraction of weeks, the team grew to 64 people in the Spring 2019. This was the largest volunteering team [that] Praan ever had,&rdquo; notes the Praan website.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;To develop filterless large space air purification technology, you need persons with different specialisations&mdash;mechanical designers, chemical engineers, physicists, full-stack developers and those with an understanding of power electronics and embedded hardware, among others. When I started developing this technology in my sophomore year, I knew how to build prototypes but knew nothing about fluid dynamics,&rdquo; Angad tells The Better India.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Each version of Praan&rsquo;s purifier was hand-built, soldered, and tested by Angad and his team in small Mumbai spaces.\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/11/05/featured-img-2025-11-05-18-47-56.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Each version of Praan&rsquo;s purifier was hand-built, soldered, and tested by Angad and his team in small Mumbai spaces.</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>So, how do you entice student volunteers to work on your project?&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>&ldquo;You give them recognition on patents, which is very valuable for a third or fourth-year engineering student. And if you can give them real hands-on skills, which they are practising through that semester, they have a good story to tell to job recruiters. Plus, given my prior experience at MIT and the network I developed there, I knew senior people who worked in companies like Apple, Tesla or SpaceX. I could help introduce these volunteers to these people, saying they worked on my project. For example, Patrick Finley, the founder of<a href=\"https://landerchallenge.space/team\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Lander Challenger</a>, went to work at SpaceX after working as a volunteer for Praan,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the following summer, Angad returned to India with one of his Teaching Assistants (TAs) and ran further experiments at a store room belonging to his father&rsquo;s company. Meanwhile, Naresh Shahani (currently a director at Praan), helped obtain an unsecured loan of $15,000 to fund the research and development. Taken in Angad&rsquo;s name, this sum was eventually doubled and returned in 2021.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Later that summer, Angad, his TA and two interns put together the prototype of what would become the MKOne Outdoor Air Purifier. The plan moving forward was that Angad would graduate in 2020, run this company full-time after graduating, and raise capital. Despite his best efforts, securing funding was a major challenge. By January 2020, investors hadn&rsquo;t caught on to the potential of deep tech and the offers on the table were not satisfactory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite these challenges, he managed &ldquo;to pool together some soft commitments worth $1.35M from an Indian VC fund and a few strategic angels on very bad investment terms&rdquo;. As these deals were being finalised, the COVID-19 pandemic struck and everything fell apart. Yet to graduate from college, he had to pack everything up and come back to India while completing online classes to get his degree.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But there was a silver lining. Since people were losing their jobs and internships, there were many looking to work on something that would advance their careers. Similar to what he did earlier, Angad offered recognition on Praan patents to anyone who helped develop the technology further either remotely or even as a volunteer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In total, Praan managed to onboard about 60 volunteers from multiple time zones who chose to dedicate about four months of their time to work on their technology.&nbsp; While the hardware was built and developed out of Angad and his intern&rsquo;s bedrooms in <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/337225/volunteer-beach-cleanup-akshat-shah-shubh-mehta-mumbai-new-year-resolution/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mumbai</a>, other volunteers from around the world contributed with their ideas and engineering drawings for their prototypes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to the Praan website, there were also &ldquo;design teams working on ideas for the MK One product, the indoor air purification, bioengineering, carbon capture, and software engineering products&mdash;all without any capital in the bank&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Real funding and assistance finally came in the form of Emergent Ventures, a fellowship and grant programme run by famous economist Dr. Tyler Cowen. It gave this fledgling startup the largest grant during the lockdown period which helped them access capital to build prototypes and test rigs as well. In the next few months, they developed a working prototype of the MKOne Outdoor Air purifier in India.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, there was very little customer or investor interest and a negligible amount of vendors were willing to manufacture the MKOne prototype. Angad spent about five months waiting for vendors to manufacture the first usable MKOne prototype. Tired of waiting, Angad decided &ldquo;to build the first MKOne prototype at a utensil manufacturing plant.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While there were differences between this prototype and future products in terms of dimensions and finishing, they finally had a real product that they could show investors. Moreover, it gave the Praan team real confidence that they could start to manufacture this product in India.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cw2hbhUt6-l/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;\" target=\"_blank\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 14px;\">\n<div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px;\"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px;\"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent;\"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-right: 8px solid transparent;\"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12px; width: 16px;\"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-left: 8px solid transparent;\"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</a>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cw2hbhUt6-l/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Praan, Inc.

The MK-II device was designed for industrial use cases&mdash;factory floors where there are incredibly high dust volumes and levels.

Select the right container &amp; soil</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span></span><span>Use a pot at least 14 &ndash; 18 inches deep with drainage holes.

Pruning</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Pruning is key to keeping your bonsai healthy and well-shaped. Regular pruning controls both the plant and root growth, strengthens existing roots, and ensures better fruiting. You can also wire branches once they are sturdy to guide them into the shape you want.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>When repotting from one container to another, prune the roots to prevent overcrowding and encourage a strong, compact root system.

Flowering &amp; fruiting</strong><span><br /></span><br />Feed your plant every 3 &ndash; 4 weeks during the growing season (spring to monsoon) with compost tea or a liquid citrus fertiliser.

That&rsquo;s all it takes to spark wonder.<br />Hold a chickpea in your palm &mdash; tiny, plain, and light &mdash; and it&rsquo;s hard to imagine the life waiting inside it. In a few weeks, that same seed can split open, stretch towards the sun, and grow pods filled with more seeds of its own.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For a child, this feels almost magical. Growing <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/301633/black-chickpeas-kala-chana-soup-recipe-full-of-protein-aids-healthy-weight-loss-food-science/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">chickpeas at home</a> turns an everyday seed into a living lesson in care and patience. Each stage &mdash; planting, watering, waiting &mdash; becomes a story of curiosity and discovery, where children get to watch life unfold right before their eyes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here&rsquo;s a simple, step-by-step way to help them begin this small but wonderful journey.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Select healthy seeds</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The adventure begins with selecting the seeds. Pick firm, unblemished chickpeas meant for home cultivation, as vitality is key to successful germination. Children can enjoy examining each seed &mdash; its size, shape, and texture &mdash; and even counting them carefully. This first step encourages attentiveness, anticipation, and a sense of excitement for the journey ahead.</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"grow chickpeas with kids\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/11/05/grow-chickpeas-with-kids-2025-11-05-12-40-18.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Growing chickpeas at home turns an everyday seed into a living lesson in care and patience. Photograph: <a href=\"https://www.thespruce.com/chickpea-care-guide-6456180\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(The Spruce)</a></em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Choose a sunny spot</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chickpeas thrive in well-lit and sunny spots. Whether planting in a garden bed or a large container, make sure the area receives plenty of sunlight. For containers, choose a pot at least 30 cm deep with good drainage to prevent waterlogging.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let children help choose or decorate the pots and arrange them in sunlit corners. It makes the growing space more personal and exciting&mdash;a small stage for life to unfold.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Prepare rich, well-drained soil</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Healthy soil forms the base for strong growth. Chickpeas prefer loamy, <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/418345/how-to-grow-passion-fruit-at-home-gardening-tips-step-by-step-guide-to-follow/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">well-drained soil</a> enriched with compost or well-rotted manure. Children can join in by mixing the soil and feeling its texture, learning how fertile earth sustains life. This tactile activity strengthens their connection between preparation, care, and growth.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. Soak the seeds before sowing</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before sowing, soak the seeds in water for eight to 12 hours. This softens their outer coats and helps them germinate faster. Watching the seeds swell can be fascinating for children &mdash; it&rsquo;s their first glimpse of change and a spark of curiosity about how life begins.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">5. Plant the seeds evenly</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Plant each seed gently two to three centimetres below the soil surface, spacing them about 20 centimetres apart so roots and shoots have room to grow. In containers, one seed per hole is enough.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"grow chickpeas with kids\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/11/05/grow-chickpeas-with-kids-2025-11-05-12-43-30.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Whether planting in a garden bed or a large container, make sure the area receives plenty of sunlight.

Keep the soil moist but not soaked</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chickpeas need consistent moisture, especially during germination, but too much water can harm them. Teach children how to <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/youth/young-innovators/sharanya-mehta-class-12-student-decision-support-system-irrigation-app-rural-farmers-10504004\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sprinkle water evenly</a> and check the soil&rsquo;s dampness with their fingers. This daily care builds patience, attentiveness, and a sense of responsibility &mdash; reminding them that living things thrive when cared for thoughtfully.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">7. Let the sunlight in</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sunlight is essential for chickpeas to grow well. They need at least six to eight hours of light each day.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Position containers or garden beds where they&rsquo;ll get full sun, and encourage children to observe how leaves turn towards the light. These small changes transform routine care into a fun lesson in science and the patterns of nature.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">8. Support the growing stems</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the stems grow taller, they may need support to stay upright. Simple sticks or small trellises can keep them from bending or breaking. Children can help tie the stems gently, learning how <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/446695/grow-amla-in-pots-container-gardening-indian-gooseberry-gardening-steps-grow-in-compact-spaces/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">care and gentleness protect growth</a> and strength.</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"grow chickpeas with kids\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/11/05/grow-chickpeas-with-kids-2025-11-05-12-46-56.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Children can help tie the stems gently, learning how care and gentleness protect growth. Photograph: <a href=\"https://harvesttotable.com/how_to_grow_chickpeas_garbanzo/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(Harvest to Table)</a></em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">9. Observe the growth</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Growth takes time. Encourage children to notice new shoots, emerging leaves, and delicate flowers. This stage nurtures mindfulness, curiosity, and appreciation for the slow, steady work of nature. Every observation is a reminder that patience and care always bear fruit.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">10. Harvest the results</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After about three to four months, when the pods dry and turn golden brown, it&rsquo;s time to harvest. Children can pluck the pods and open them to find the seeds inside, witnessing the tangible result of their effort. Harvesting becomes both a reward and a final lesson in the satisfaction that comes from <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/294514/german-teacher-sets-up-sustainable-dairy-farm-natural-farming-earns-lakhs/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">care and consistency</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Growing chickpeas may start as a small home project, but for children, it often becomes something much deeper &mdash; a story of life unfolding in their own hands.</p>",

      "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91429737/what-failure-taught-me-about-entrepreneurship-fauilure-entrepreneurship",
      "summary": "<p>Over the past 50 years in the shoe trade, I have had my fair share of failure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest lesson I learned, at the start of my career, is not to devote time and energy to a business or project that has little chance of success. This might sound obvious, however sometimes you are so involved in the detail of the day to day running of the business that you don’t stand back and question the future viability of what you are doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was a women’s shoe manufacturer in London in the 1980s. If I had looked at the big picture I would have seen that the future of manufacturing in the U.K. for low technology, high labor content businesses like footwear manufacturing, was unsustainable. Most of the production was moving to Asia where costs were much lower and the quality was excellent. It took a visit to Taiwan to see the same shoes being made at half the price that it was costing us in our London factory to persuade me to leave manufacturing and become an importer. My lesson is to respond quickly and try and anticipate change.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pressure-on-middlemen\">Pressure on middlemen</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another example is from the 2000s. I was a successful importer from Asia, a business I set up in 1986 called Browning Enterprises. It had a turnover of £60m. As communications improved and markets opened, more Chinese manufacturers and trading companies came directly to the major U.K. retailers, putting pressure on the margins of the middlemen, like me. Our costs were too high. We couldn’t compete. The import company struggled on till 2009.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the decline in the importing business and the desire to start my own brand that led to me to launch Dune in 1992.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-temper-your-optimism\">Temper your optimism</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another failure was opening unprofitable stores. This is an expensive mistake as the £400k investment is written off when the store is closed. The failure is usually due to overestimating the level of sales. The costs of a new store are easily calculated. The big variable, that is largely a matter of judgement, is the sales number. Of course you do your due diligence by looking at footfall figures, studying demographics, and talking to adjacent stores to try and judge their performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, you come to a sales number. The lesson is to be cautious about the level of sales. Look carefully at the possible downsides. As an entrepreneur your natural tendency is to be optimistic. You must temper this optimism. Resist the temptation to open the shop because you want to grow. It has got to make commercial sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an entrepreneur it is easy to get distracted and sidetracked into ventures that are not related to your area of expertise. This loss of focus can be damaging, as not only is there a high probability that the new venture is unprofitable and you will lose money, but it also takes your attention away from your main activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-not-special\">Not special</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My career has been in fashion footwear. That’s what I know. However, during the pandemic, I launched a sustainable trainer brand. I felt that was where the growth was in footwear, so that’s where I needed to be.&nbsp; It was a failure. Why? Two reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, it wasn’t special enough. It was a good, well-made sustainable product but in a crowded market it didn’t have an important point of difference that would make it stand out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, we didn’t go out and aggressively sell the product. I thought I would generate the online sales through the website. This was a mistake. We needed to sell wholesale as well, not only to generate sales but to get the brand out there in the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two important lessons for entrepreneurs here. One: Don’t underestimate the <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/marketing\" title=\"Marketing\">marketing</a> cost of selling a new brand online. Two: You may have a great product, but it is essential that you get out there and sell. It is no coincidence that over the years the sales team has been the highest earners in the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-avoid-distraction\">Avoid distraction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We launched a range of children’s shoes. This was related to our main activity, but as we found to our cost, the market is very different from adult’s shoes. As we didn’t have the space in our stores to offer the range we focussed on online and wholesale. Selling a new brand of children’s shoes online was more difficult than we anticipated. Mothers like to buy their kids’ shoes in a physical store. In addition, the market was polarized between the established heritage brands, Clarks and Startrite, and the large stores like Next, Marks &amp; Spencer, and Zara, who were offering similar shoes at lower prices. The lesson is clear. Resist the temptation to get distracted unless you are very confident that the new venture is financially compelling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-right-team\">The right team</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, having the right team in place is essential. As an entrepreneur there is a danger that you are reluctant to give up control. It is essential to recognize the limitations of your abilities and <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/hiring\" title=\"Hiring\">hire</a> a team that can do things better than you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The importance of building the right team came into sharp focus in 2009 when we acquired a company called Shoe Studio and trebled our size. A year after the acquisition we started to struggle. Our profits fell. We didn’t have the management expertise to run a larger business. My skills and time were being stretched to the limit. We employed a first-class FD and a team of senior experienced retailers which transformed the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a well-known expression that you learn more from your failures than your successes. That is certainly my experience. And if the project is failing, then fail fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

To capitalize on that trend—and give candy canes a run for their money—Hershey’s new peppermint Kit Kat bars come in three sizes to appease all hunger magnitudes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the classic Hershey’s Milk Chocolate Bars are continuing their partnership with the Grinch, Dr. Seuss&#8217;s iconic Christmas hater. Popular characters such as Cindy Lou Who, Max, and the big-hearted green guy himself are featured on the packaging and in the design of the chocolate for a fun, festive treat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whimsical shapes are also here to stay. Reese’s Peanut Butter Trees, now available in a mini version, are a perfect tree-trimming snack.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-hershey-became-a-confectionary-powerhouse\">How Hershey became a confectionary powerhouse</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These days, the name Hershey is synonymous with chocolate bars, but the company actually started with caramel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1886, Milton S. Hershey founded the Lancaster Caramel Co. in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Hershey got the idea to make chocolate while attending the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/money/Hershey-Chocolate-Corporation\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">World’s Columbian Exposition</a> in Chicago in 1893, and wasted no time launching the Hershey Chocolate Co. as a subsidiary of his original business the following year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1900, he sold Lancaster Caramel but retained the chocolate side of the business. That same year, Hershey started selling milk chocolate bars. Chocolate Kisses made their debut seven years later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1925, the Goodbar was introduced, and in 1963 Hershey acquired H.B. Reese Candy Co.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today Hershey is the parent company for more than 100 brands, including Jolly Rancher, Rolos, and SkinnyPop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a market cap of roughly $34 billion, the company reported net sales of $11.2 billion last year. And it&#8217;s not just about sweet treats. Hershey’s salty snacks unit in North America <a href=\"https://hershey.gcs-web.com/static-files/227fb818-6d03-4675-ae48-e5bd4cfe8014\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">grew 10%</a> in the third quarter of this year, generating $321 million.</p>\n\n\n<hr />",

While some schools forbid the pupils from bringing specific food items, others provide the standard peanut butter and jelly sandwich meal packs.

One day, her daughter came home from school to reveal how their teacher made them feel about \"bad food\" in their tiffin box.</p><p>Her daughter said that they were made to start their lunch with the \"good\" food items in their box before moving to the \"bad\" food items. In the case of Caroline's <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/this-photo-of-a-school-lunch-in-south-korea-sparked-a-debate-ex1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">daughter's lunchbox</a>, the sandwich and fruits were considered \"good\" whereas the cookies were considered \"bad.\" As confusing as it might sound to others, Caroline additionally wrote in the caption of her TikTok <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@pezzi.shop/video/7333271981351128366\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">video</a>, “My three-year-old came home from school yesterday, telling me that her teacher told her that she had to eat all of her 'good' foods before she ate her 'bad' foods.\" Caroline can be seen opening the lunchbox briefly to show the kind of food items she had given to her daughter. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"lunch, school lunch, kids, parents, food\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"91d11\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjA5NjkxMC9vcmlnaW4uZ2lmIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MzU3MzEwNn0.l1NwvFt50JIRpiNjXYR9pDKdkH009bbni_dzyyv3o0g/img.gif?width=980\" />        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">hey arnold nicksplat GIF</small>        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">            <a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/heyarnold-hey-arnold-nicksplat-l4Ep6sIcT2T0wsJLa\" target=\"_blank\">Giphy</a>        </small>        </p><p>There is a peeled orange, some chopped strawberries, two cookies, a sandwich in a wrap and cut cucumbers wrapped securely in the side. \"She couldn’t have her cookie before eating her sandwich and cucumbers.

She couldn’t have her cookie before eating her sandwich and cucumbers.  In this moment, I felt a little frustrated by the antiquated instruction from the teacher, but I responded saying, “Well that’s silly. There are no good foods or bad foods. Food is just food!“  I will say, this was not my internal dialogue growing up, but because of the information that I have from so many great accounts created by moms and experts, in the field of childhood and nutrition, I am armed with better responses, knowledge and practices for my kids.  Three years old. At three years old someone has told her that foods are good or bad. I am so proud that she had sensed something was off -  to know that was not right enough to tell me about it. We talk about it all the time at home… If you only eat carrots or broccoli your body won’t have protein it needs to grow strong muscles. If you only eat chicken, your body won’t have enough energy to do things like run and play all day long. We need little bits of everything to make sure that we are able to learn and play and grow all day long. So to the accounts that make sure we have the words, knowledge and confidence to write the note and practice it at home, I thank you, thank you, thank you. It has changed our family for the better.

When you find out he's barely 4 years old, hearing him calmly talk about his emotions and good choices is all the more remarkable.</p><p>Aldie's mom, Jonisa Padernos, tells Upworthy that she's felt he was \"really special\" since he started talking in full sentences at 20 months. \"Believe it or not, he had no major tantrums in his toddler years because he was always able to express [himself] with his words,\" she says.</p><p><br /></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"emotional intelligence, Aldie, @mom_aldie, TikTok, viral video, parenting, gentle parenting, Jonisa Padernos, articulating emotions, kids\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"628ea\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjA5ODY2Mi9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3Mzg5NTk1NH0._ROalwKlsOjBegdpAqS9b0YRLPqOi3O9olWIniEB9zk/img.png?width=980\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Screenshots of a mom and her 4-year-old talking</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@mom_aldie/video/7215376685808520454\" target=\"_blank\">@mom_aldie/TikTok@mom_aldie</a>/TikTok</small></p><p>Padernos started young, asking Aldie questions and giving him time to answer without interrupting. \"I’d always ask his opinion or feelings towards something and I don’t rush him to answer,\" she says. \"I give him time and just listen.

Always remember that kids mirror us and so we have to show and express our emotions so they will be encouraged to also express their feelings to us. And when we get mad or frustrated, also let them know and explain why and apologize if you feel that you’ve let your emotions get in the way.\"</p><p>While not every child will be able to understand and articulate as clearly as Aldie did at such a young age, most kids are far more capable of understanding and processing emotion than we give them credit for. Proactively teaching them how to communicate what they're feeling and explaining how emotions work can go a long way toward helping them develop the self-regulation tools they'll use throughout their life.</p><p><em>This article originally appeared two years ago. </em></p>",

So when parents are <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/moste-hireable-names\" target=\"_blank\">choosing baby names</a> out of the innumerable possibilities, there's a lot to consider. </p><p>One consideration is popularity. Some parents <a href=\"https://www.good.is/baby-names-that-are-going-extinct\" target=\"_blank\">don't want a popular name </a>for their child, while others are drawn to the trends of their time.

If you like <em>The Pitt</em>, the names <strong>Samira</strong> and <strong>Heather</strong> have gone up 276 and 116 spots, respectively. <strong>Belinda</strong> climbed a head-turning 2,402 spots, which BabyCenter connects with the show <em>White Lotus. </em>The names <strong>Chelsea</strong> for girls and <strong>Valentin</strong> and <strong>Fabian</strong> for boys have also seen a jump (though not nearly as large as Belinda).

But even when it’s not Halloween, the internet is still chock full of examples of people going “all in”—in other words, being their most creative, joyful, and passionate selves, unapologetically and out loud. </p><p>We’ve written a lot about what it means to live this way—and this Friday, we’re continuing the tradition.

What do you do? If you’re this hilarious family, you throw an entire funeral so everyone can lay the pacifier to rest once and for all. We can’t get over how elaborate this staged funeral is, from the “mourners” to the piano playing softly in the background as the eulogy is delivered to the BALLOON RELEASE at the end. It's absolute perfection from start to finish. No word yet on how Savannah (the pacifier owner) reacted to the loss of her beloved paci, but if this production doesn’t help her give it up, then probably nothing will.</p><h3>This dog photoshoot </h3><br /><blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@franklinbarkzoo/video/7566680093251161357\" class=\"tiktok-embed\"> <section> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@franklinbarkzoo?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@franklinbarkzoo\">@franklinbarkzoo</a> Replying to @kate <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7566680199731890958?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - franklinbarkzoo\">♬ original sound - franklinbarkzoo</a> </section> </blockquote> We’ve written about couple’s costumes, and we’ve written about group costumes.

In this video, TikTok creator Lisa Hefferman (who runs a dog walking and boarding service in South Boston called @ultimuttpaws) lines up her extremely well-behaved dogs for a Halloween photoshoot. Lisa’s dedication to getting the perfect shot is definitely something to be admired (“Rufus, you’re, like, <em>too present.”</em>), but we have to give the dogs credit, too.

      "summary": "<p>One man’s trash is Danny Shaddick’s treasure. The Toronto architect-artist-musician’s latest work marries recordings of everyday sounds with pieces of scrap metal to create intricate instruments that produce rhythmic soundscapes on their own.</p>\n<p>The project, a collaboration with award-winning Canadian rapper and recording artist Shadrach Kabango, a.k.a. Shad, aims to express the energy of Toronto and represent the city's unique culture.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>“Our creation is a collaborative robot percussion instrument built from reclaimed materials and designed to perform with live vocals,” says Shaddick, who, like Shad, grew up in nearby London, Ontario.</p>\n<p>If that sounds unusual, so was Shaddick’s process: He salvaged pieces from Toronto Transit Commission refuse barns and made field recordings throughout the city, in and around transit vehicles, and down by the water. These recordings were cut and mixed together to create a sonic backdrop to the project’s mechanical centerpiece.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/106088/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p>Next, Shad layered his original lyrics and vocals live on top of the robotic percussive components and found-sound atmosphere. Shad pays tribute to Toronto in verse: <em>“Friends blending machine and machine like / The wide screens so / We represent the scene right ... We make space / Where trees stood in the Great Lakes / Meeting place where new / Relations would take shape.”</em></p>\n<p>The result, Moving Monuments, reframes what a monument can be - not something fixed in place, but the living, breathing movement of the people who give Toronto its rhythm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"article-second-subheading-pre-rd\">Listen to Moving Monuments</h3>\n<p><audio controls=\"controls\" src=\"https://images.atlasobscura.com/aon/hubs/toronto2025/movingmonuments.mp3\"></audio></p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/106094/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p>“Toronto is home, first and foremost,” says Shad, host of Netflix docuseries, “Hip-Hop Evolution.” He’s found the city’s embrace of all genres and rhythms to be unique. “This is a savvy music town.”</p>\n<p>The duo landed on the idea, in part inspired by Toronto’s annual street festivals like Toronto Caribbean Carnival, celebrating the city’s Caribbean community, and Taste of Manila, which centers on Filipino food and culture.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/106093/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p>Shaddick has been passionate about finding the rhythm and music in machinery for decades. A previous project, Robot Orchestra, in which machines played acoustic instruments, was a response to the pandemic physically separating artists.</p>\n<p>“You can invent new music when you invent a new instrument,” Shaddick says.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/106090/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p>With “Moving Monuments,” which looks a bit like a drum machine that wants to be a towering tree, the repurposed parts create their own unique sounds when struck by programmable electronic components. Shaddick also sourced additional pieces from favorite shops, including drums from Soul Drums in Uptown Toronto, shakers from African Drum and Arts Craft on Dundas Street, and cabasas from Steve’s Music on Queen Street West.</p>\n<p>The structural center of the instrument is a standard lighting rig truss, meaning the parts can be attached in dozens of different ways. Shaddick imagines that as the piece travels around the world, showing off the best of Toronto, it can be broken down and reassembled “in ways that are a little bit improvisational,” reflecting the humanity of the automated rhythms. The robot stands tall, covered and surrounded by human elements: local instruments, personal lyrics, the rhythms of Toronto's cultures and community.</p>\n<p>Sustainability is a vital element of all of Danny’s inventive projects. “Danny’s approach to sustainability is, like Toronto, charmingly understated and practically wise,” says Shad.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/106089/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p>Shaddick values how Shad brought an essential lyrical layer to the endeavor. “With this project, it couldn't just be rhythm. It needed more of a soul. It needed a voice. That's where Shad comes in,” Shaddick says of his multidisciplinary collaborator. “He's amazing, an amazing lyricist.”</p>\n<p>Both collaborators hope that the project will bring new attention to the possibilities of combining art and technology as well as to Toronto’s unique mix of sounds and cultures.</p>",

      "title": "The Surprising Culinary History of a Humble Puerto Rican Favorite",
      "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/trifongo-recipe",
      "summary": "<p>Aida Lugo McAllister still remembers the first time she tried Puerto Rico’s unofficial national dish.</p>\n<p>“When I went to Puerto Rico, 1970, at age 17, that’s when I had my first mofongo. And it was heaven,” she remembers. “A mountain of this mashed plantain with pieces of pork in a sauce. Delicious.”</p>\n<p>Mofongo is the first food people bring up when they talk about the island, says Lugo McAllister, a Puerto Rican home cook who has published recipes on her website <a href=\"https://aidaskitchenboricua.com/about-us/\">Aida’s Kitchen</a> and in her bilingual cookbook, <a href=\"https://aidaskitchenboricua.com/\"><em>Aida’s Kitchen a lo Boricua</em></a>. A rich, starchy mash of fried green plantains, garlic, olive oil, and chicharrón (pork cracklings), it’s the perfect accompaniment to broths and stewed meats. Growing up in Gary, Indiana, Lugo McAllister and her family didn’t have ready access to green plantains, so she didn’t try mofongo until she moved to the island as a teen. But the dish’s impression on her was immediate.</p>\n<p>“So delicious, so moist, and it came in a mortar,” she recalls. She has since published recipes for a <a href=\"https://aidaskitchenboricua.com/healthier-version-of-mofongo/\">“healthier” mofongo</a> (sans pork cracklings) on her website and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slxf1Og4L8I&amp;t=34s\">YouTube</a>. Lugo McAllister is joined by influencers all over the internet who fry and mash plantains in wooden mortars. “When you think of Puerto Rican gastronomy, I’m sure that the first thing you think of is mofongo,” says the content creator Natalia Bercero on <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@mamichanchu/video/7246477103045152046?lang=en&amp;q=mofongo&amp;t=1760029626746\">TikTok</a>, before whipping up the dish for her fans.</p>\n<p>Though it has contemporary appeal, mofongo’s roots are deep. The dish reflects the intertwined histories of African, European, and Indigenous people in Puerto Rico. Taíno people, native to the Caribbean islands, used a pilón, a wooden mortar and pestle, to <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/a-brief-history-of-puerto-ricos-beloved-mofongo-180979947/\">grind ingredients together</a>. Their civilization was <a href=\"https://tainomuseum.org/taino/history/\">flourishing</a> before Christopher Columbus arrived in the Caribbean in 1492. Soon after, Spanish colonists attacked and enslaved the Taíno, putting them to work in gold mines and plantations. So many Taíno died under colonial rule that the Spanish brought enslaved West Africans to the island to replace their dwindling workforce.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/106078/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p>In West Africa, cooks have long prepared fufu, a dish of plantains, yams, or cassava that is boiled, then mashed. Enslaved Africans brought that same technique to Puerto Rico. They also introduced plantains, which grew easily on the island and became “the main source of food for the slaves and the poor people,” said Lugo McAllister, who moved back from Puerto Rico to Indiana in her mid-20s.</p>\n<p>Plantains are closely related to the banana, but in their green, unripe form, they’re not sweet, and can be used as a neutral starch similar to a potato. Over time, African cooks combined plantain-based fufu with European ingredients like garlic, oil, and chicharrón for flavor and moisture. The late food historian Cruz Miguel Ortíz Cuadra wrote in Eating Puerto Rico: A History of Food, Culture, and Identity, that the word “mofongo” comes from an Angolan Kikongo term, <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/a-brief-history-of-puerto-ricos-beloved-mofongo-180979947/\">“mfwenge-mfwenge,”</a> which means “a great amount of anything at all.”</p>\n<p>But that doesn’t mean mofongo is a breeze to make. “It’s a food that’s preferred eaten at a restaurant,” said Lugo McAllister. “Because of the many steps involved.” Even some restaurants <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/a-brief-history-of-puerto-ricos-beloved-mofongo-180979947/\">avoid</a> making the dish because of the amount of elbow grease involved in smashing plantains. Still, mofongo is a cornerstone of Puerto Rican gastronomy, and each restaurant prepares it in its own way. Some serve it in a pilón for extra flare. A main course is typically served on the side or in a well in the middle of the mound.</p>\n<p>In Kissimmee, Florida, where more than half of the city’s 85,000 residents are of Puerto Rican descent, there’s no shortage of good mofongo. The chefs at El Cilantrillo, a Kissimmee restaurant known for delicious cooking, huge portions, and live music, prepare a particularly good one. “I will say that I'm a mofongos tester,” said Yannick Jordan, a Puerto Rican-raised project manager for the company of restaurants that includes El Cilantrillo. “El Cilantrillo’s is still my favorite mofongo that I have ever tried.” On the softer side, with a strong garlic flavor, their mofongo comes in a pilón bearing the restaurant’s name, and can be ordered stuffed with everything from octopus to Impossible Meat. It’s their best seller.</p>\n<p>As with any great dish, mofongo has seen its fair share of spinoffs in recent years. Creative cooks in Puerto Rico and the mainland are trying their own takes on garlicky mashed plantains. There’s Lugo McAllister’s vegetarian mofongo, for example. For a festive appetizer, cooks shape smaller amounts of smashed plantains into little cups and fry them to make <a href=\"https://www.dominicancooking.com/mofonguito-maduro-plantain-cups\">“mofonguitos”</a> that they fill with meat.</p>\n<p>El Cilantrillo is a purveyor of another mofongo innovation: trifongo, a mofongo made with a trifecta of green plantains, yuca (cassava), and maduros (ripe, sweet plantains). Lugo McAllister said that when she first experienced mofongo in the 1970s, trifongo was uncommon.</p>\n<p>The yuca in trifongo is a mildly sweet, <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/22745164/what-is-cassava-how-to-use-cooking-recipes\">starchy tuber cultivated by the Taínos</a> that is now a staple throughout Latin America, Asia, and Africa. El Cilantrillo’s trifongo contains no chicharrón, and gets some extra moisture and umami flavor from chicken broth and seasoning.</p>\n<p>Lugo McAllister says that when it comes to making mofongo, the challenge is in getting the texture right. “It needs to be moist but not greasy,” she says.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/106076/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p>Yuca and plantain are all somewhat dry once they’re mashed, so it’s the job of the cook to add fat and liquid to moisten them. “If you don't put fat or some type of liquid, oh my god, you won't be able to even swallow it,” Lugo McAllister warns. Traditionally, cooks would derive moisture from chicharrón, but many modern mofongos, like El Cilantrillo’s trifongo, are moistened with broth and olive oil. To prevent yourself from overdoing the fat, Lugo McAllister says to add it little by little, tasting to see when the texture is to your liking.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the goal isn’t a puree, but rather a mash with plenty of crispy chunks. Lugo McAllister recommends smashing the starches while they’re still hot from cooking, because they become much harder to manipulate once they cool down. If you don’t have a mortar and pestle, you can put the starches in a stainless steel bowl, cover them with a kitchen towel, and pound them with a mallet. Placing them in a plastic bag and smashing them with the flat bottom of a cup or a pan can work, too.</p>\n<p>Lastly, there’s the flavor. Yuca and green plantain are pretty bland, so salt, garlic, and other seasonings are crucial. “It’s supposed to have a lot of garlic flavor,” Lugo McAllister said. Her healthy take on mofongo includes cilantro, and El Cilantrillo’s gets a flavor boost from adobo, a blend of salt and spices like garlic, pepper, oregano, and turmeric that many Puerto Rican cooks keep on hand. Some cooks make it at home, but it’s also available ready-made in supermarkets.</p>\n<p>The adobo, plus the dance between green plantain, sweet plantain, and cassava makes El Cilantrillo’s trifongo anything but bland. The yuca and maduros add a dimension to mofongo that isn’t ordinarily there, Jordan said. “The cassava is more salty. Sweet plantain, of course, is sweeter. So it's like an explosion in your mouth of these two different flavors.”</p>",

This urban gem makes one appreciate the serenity of nature, even though it's only a single mural on the façade of one of the thousands of buildings in Paris. </p>\n<p>This 25-meter-high green mural features more than 7,000 plants from 237 species, arranged in diagonal waves that appear to climb the façade.</p>\n<p>The designer behind this art piece is Patrick Blanc, a botanist, researcher, and artist who has specialized in vertical gardens for more than 30 years. His 1986 installation at the Museum of Science and Industry in Paris is widely recognized as the first large-scale modern green wall, and he has been credited with popularizing the concept worldwide. He patented the technique he developed for growing these artificial biomes. His work caught the attention of contemporary art institutions, and shortly thereafter, he was commissioned to create several permanent installations throughout the city. This mural was established as part of the 2013 Paris Design Week. </p>\n<p>Considering its small surface area, this green wall holds an incredible amount of biodiversity in the center of Paris, not just through its vegetation, but also through the birds and insects that thrive within it. The Oasis of Aboukir acts as a portal to a tropical biome, taking you away from the rush of the city.</p>",

Now, this newly released camera-trap footage shows it’s also a skill practiced on the Batéké Plateau.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The use of a stick to investigate the trail camera is also an intriguing behaviour that wasn’t noted in a <span><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982219301630#sec1\">2019 survey</a></span> of the responses of naive African apes—chimps, bonobos, and gorillas—to camera traps. While the researchers in that study predicted that chimps would display the most curiosity toward camera traps on account of their more diverse diet and habitat preferences, in fact it was the bonobos and gorillas that “demonstrated a stronger looking impulse toward the camera trap device compared to chimpanzees, suggesting higher visual attention and curiosity.”</p>\n<figure>\n            <p>\n                    <img alt=\"chimpanzee-cameratrap-bw_2025-06-13.jpg\" src=\"https://www.earthtouchnews.com/media/1955731/chimpanzee-cameratrap-bw_2025-06-13.jpg?mode=crop&amp;width=1060&amp;height=707\" />\n                <br /><figcaption>Research shows that it's actually bonobos and gorillas that demonstrate a stronger impulse to investigate camera trap devices compared to chimps.

Of the three ape species, bonobos showed the most fearful responses to the camera traps—a reflection, perhaps, of the more egalitarian bonobo society, where the “allocation of risk is predicted to be spread more evenly within the group” as compared to chimps and gorillas, where one or a handful of individuals serve as leaders.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chimps—classified as Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)—and western lowland gorillas (Critically Endangered) are among a number of primate species recorded in Batéké Plateau National Park, also home to several kinds of monkey—from moustached monkeys and northern talapoins to mandrills, first documented in a <span><a href=\"https://www.eva.mpg.de/documents/Wiley-Blackwell/Hedwig_Camera_AfrJEco_2018_2573546.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2017 camera-trapping survey</a></span>—as well as pottos and galagos.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The park lies in southeastern Gabon and encompasses a striking landscape of ecological frontiers. It marks where the northwestern edge of the Batéké Plateau itself—a highland of sandstone and ancient sand dunes that sprawls across some six million hectares of Gabon, Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Angola—subsides to the great low-lying Gabonese rainforest. The Plateau, which includes domes and escarpments cut by rolling foothills and river valleys, harbours extensive tracts of grassland and savannah, with gallery forests—some of which finger into the highland from the bordering rainforest—threaded through as lusher ribbons of tall trees and dense understory.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A local manifestation of the extensive Western Congolian Forest-Savanna Mosaic, the Batéké’s blend of grassy glades and parkland intermixed with riverine forest makes for a fascinating faunal mashup. Here, historically, lions, spotted hyenas, waterbuck, and other savannah and woodland species shared the greater landscape with rainforest denizens such as forest elephants, forest buffalo, forest duikers, sitatunga, and red river hogs—and, of course, those two great apes (though chimps in places can be savannah-dwellers).</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Camera-trap surveys undertaken around when the park was established in 2004 and subsequently have made some major discoveries, not least (thanks to camera traps set up for chimps) the presence of a male lion in 2015 (which we reported on <span><a href=\"https://www.earthtouchnews.com/conservation/conservation/camera-trap-footage-sparks-hope-for-a-lion-comeback-in-gabon/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></span> and <span><a href=\"https://www.earthtouchnews.com/conservation/conservation/take-two-gabons-lone-lion-makes-another-on-camera-appearance/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></span>): the first well-documented observation in Gabon since 1996. <span><a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6448349/\">Genetic analysis of hair samples gathered from this lion</a></span> suggested it may have been a holdout of the so-called Batéké lions that formerly seemed to specialise in this savannah/woodland country rather than a disperser from West/Central African prides in Cameroon or the Central African Republic, separated from Gabon by dense rainforest.</p>\n<hr class=\"related-link\" />\n    <div class=\"related-more\">\n        <span>\n            Read more:\n            <a href=\"https://www.earthtouchnews.com/conservation/conservation/camera-trap-footage-sparks-hope-for-a-lion-comeback-in-gabon\">\n\t\t\tCamera trap footage sparks hope for a lion comeback in Gabon\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</a>\n        </span>\n    </div>\n    <hr class=\"related-link\" />\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, the trailcam investigated by the chimp was part of an effort by ANPN and Panthera to monitor for big cats in the park, and, <span><a href=\"https://panthera.org/blog-post/candid-wildlife-moments-caught-camera-gabons-bateke-plateau\">according to Panthera</a></span>, happened to be in the same area where the 2015 lion was documented.

Wittig, a single, never-married physician, always wanted to be a dad, but joked that he \"wished he could start fatherhood with a 13-year-old.\" Seeing this post, he saw it as the opportunity the had been praying for, and volunteered to raise the boy. After living together for months, Wittig would discover that he and the boy he adopted, Ronnie, shared a special bond, as reported by <a href=\"https://people.com/doctor-raises-teen-whose-parents-died-my-extraordinary-family-7565055\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PEOPLE</a>.</p><p>Wittig was shown a snapshot of two osteosarcoma patients he had treated in the early 1980s, over 25 years ago. Both of the women in the photo had the same type of bone cancer but received different treatments: one had a limb amputated, while the other had limb-sparing surgery.</p><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\">\n            <div style=\"padding: 8px;\">\n                <div style=\"line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;\">\n                    <div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\">\n                    <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CofS2EzuO_K/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=189a0055-8331-4239-8912-816af5d36816\" style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_top\">See on Instagram</a>\n                </p>\n                \n            </div>\n        </blockquote><p>Wittig was a fellow when he cared for the patient whose limb was saved. When her doctor, the fellowship director, retired, Wittig took over as her doctor. Wittig, the Chairman of the Department of Orthopedics at Morristown Medical Center, has used this photograph for years when giving lectures and instructing residents. The image depicted \"limb-saving surgery and osteosarcoma.\"</p><p>He never met or treated the second woman in the photos, despite having a professional relationship with the woman whose leg was saved. However, after she passed away, he raised her son. Wittig, who remained in contact with his former patient, noticed on Facebook in 2015 that she was looking for someone to care for a kid named Ronnie, the son of a friend who died as a result of complications after her amputation. The boy's father had also lately died. He contacted the patient and inquired about adopting the boy.</p><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\">\n            <div style=\"padding: 8px;\">\n                <div style=\"line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;\">\n                    <div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\">\n                    <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CmmqctUO_B5/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=d5ff3f12-ef4a-4edd-9e23-6820942a78b9\" style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_top\">See on Instagram</a>\n                </p>\n                \n            </div>\n        </blockquote><p>In February 2015, Wittig drove from his home near Morristown, New Jersey, to northern Virginia to meet the youngster in person. Soon after that encounter, his patient called to say Ronnie wanted to meet Wittig's family. Wittig learned the youngster had elected to live with him hours after the second visit. Ronnie's legal guardianship was transferred to Wittig two weeks later.</p><p>Wittig recognized the boy's mother as the other woman in the photograph he had used in presentations for many years after they had been living together for a few months. The coincidence convinced him that this link was predestined. \"I see this whole thing as a synchronicity,\" he explained. Ronnie struck him as \"one of the strongest and kindest and most courageous kids.\" Ronnie went on to attend Seton Hall Prep and completed welding school.</p><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\">\n            <div style=\"padding: 8px;\">\n                <div style=\"line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;\">\n                    <div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\">\n                    <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Ceb_Q6CuH7M/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=396d3bfe-a47f-4b2d-95b8-42bbeaa706a5\" style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_top\">See on Instagram</a>\n                </p>\n                \n            </div>\n        </blockquote><p>Wittig has yet to legally adopt Ronnie, now an adult, but believes the process will be completed in a year or two. He hinted that their relationship is more than just a piece of paper. Being a parent with a child to \"love\" and \"care about\" has been \"so fulfilling\" for the oncologist. He mentors and leads him through life while also learning from him. Wittig says his son has taught him \"kindness, compassion, empathy, love, joy, and happiness\" in spades.</p><p>He wrote about Ronnie on his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CofS2EzuO_K/?img_index=4\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>, \"6 years ago today, I had the best thing happen to me, becoming your Dad! It’s one of the biggest miracles in my life, and I am so proud to call you my son! Proud of all you have accomplished and the person you have become! You are amazing to me and my hero! I am always here for you, my son! Love you, buddy!\" He believes that his tale may inspire other older, single men and women who desire to have children to realize that it is not too late.</p><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\">\n            <div style=\"padding: 8px;\">\n                <div style=\"line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;\">\n                    <div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\">\n                    <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CkpB0XgMpwC/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=766c611e-00a0-4424-ae87-a91f122807f5\" style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_top\">See on Instagram</a>\n                </p>\n                \n            </div>\n        </blockquote><p><em>This article originally appeared 2 years ago.</em></p>",

One might show up to help or check in, not realizing the other person has already been doing something kind for them.

Decorations were up, guests were waiting quietly, and everything was set for him to walk through the door and be surprised. But what she didn't know was that her boyfriend would show up with <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/flower-girl-falls-asleep-three-guys-step-in-to-be-flower-bros\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">flowers</a>.

As she explained in the video, \"Me trying to throw my bf a surprise birthday party while he thinks I had a bad day and brings me flowers to cheer me up.\" When she opened the door, he was standing there with a bouquet, completely unaware of the surprise behind him. Her reaction said it all. She was caught off guard, smiled, and quickly tried to manage the moment without giving anything away. A few seconds later, the surprise went ahead as planned — friends jumped out, the celebration started, and he finally understood why she looked so shocked.</p><h2>Why mutual support matters</h2>        <p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"76cb9\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjA4Mjg1NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgxNzM3NjU3OH0.2tdkaRLKKztOzPtErsMccvGFk3XGeK0UD2jA-kN2hyg/img.jpg?width=980\" />                <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">TikTok | @annarelamartinez</small>        </p>            <p>For many people watching the video, what stood out wasn’t the party — it was the way he walked in thinking of her. He didn’t know what she was planning, and he had no idea the evening was meant to celebrate him. He just thought she needed a small gesture to feel better. This moment highlights the concept of mutual support in relationships. A study published in the <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/02654075251336872\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Journal of Social and Personal Relationships</a> found that both giving and receiving emotional support contribute to lower levels of depressive symptoms in couples.

That's the case with <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/2020/11/25/miley-cyrus-cody-simpson-breakup-realization/\">Miley Cyrus</a> and her sister Noah Cyrus, who is 7 years her junior.</p><p>While Miley rose to fame on the Disney Channel as <em>Hannah Montana </em>and later took the music scene by storm,<em> </em>in recent years Noah Cyrus began releasing music too. But back in May, while discussing the release of her EP, <em>The End of Everything</em>, Noah <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a32580033/noah-cyrus-young-and-sad-miley-cyrus-sister/\" target=\"_blank\">recalled emotionally</a> what it was like to grow up as Miley Cyrus's little sister. “It was absolutely unbearable,” she said.</p><p>“Whenever I was younger, there were a lot of comparisons and there were a lot of things said about me and the way I look that destroyed me becoming an adult,” <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/noah-cyrus-the-heartbreaking-thing-that-changed-miley-cyruss-sisters-life-when-she-was-seven.html/\" target=\"_blank\">Noah has said</a>. </p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-custom1\" id=\"cite0\">That destroyed my view of myself. That wouldn’t have happened if I wasn’t a public person since birth. That wasn’t my choice. I love my family but everybody has their issues. This was mine. It really f***ed me up.<br /><cite>Noah Cyrus</cite></blockquote><p><div class=\"rm-shortcode\">\n<div class=\"jwplayer-media\" id=\"botr_yh17SUWU_IXU6no1G_div\">\n<img class=\"jwplayer-media-preview\" src=\"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/yh17SUWU-1920.jpg\" />\n</div>\n\n</div></p><h2>Noah Cyrus was 'in the shadows' of sister Miley</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\"><img alt=\"Miley cyrus noah 1024x574\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"2aa99\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/miley-cyrus-noah-1024x574.jpg?id=51947808&amp;width=980\" /></figure><p>Although a talented musician on her own, Noah had trouble growing up with Billy Ray Cyrus as her dad and Miley as her older sister. Noah said she wrote the song, “Young and Sad,” based on the experience of growing up hidden in her sister’s “shadows.”</p><p>The song goes a little something like this:</p><p>“My sister's like sunshine / Always bringing good light wherever she'll go / And I was born to rain clouds / Blessed in her shadows.”</p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-custom1\" id=\"cite1\">That's why everybody always says to me, that no matter what, I was going to be in that shadow. And I always believed that, and that's so hard for me to overcome.<br /><cite>Noah Cyrus</cite></blockquote><p>“Being born in the family I was in, everybody gave me such a hard time for having a hard time being Miley's little sister, but I always felt like I was that person that no one gave a shit about due to what people said to me online,” <a href=\"https://tearfully\" target=\"_blank\">she said</a>, while shedding tears. </p><p>Hopefully, now that she has been more open about her feelings, she is able to start healing from that early trauma. After all, opening up about one’s feelings, no matter how hard they are to express—and no matter how much judgement one might face for doing so—typically does wonders for the healing process.</p><p>With all that said, Miley and Noah have a close relationship. Contrary to popular belief, there is no bitter rivalry. Sure, they’ve gone through tough times together, but who hasn't – both sisters are completely honest about that.</p><h3>Noah Cyrus and Miley Cyrus set an example for sisterhood</h3><p>These days, both Noah and Miley put out amazing music and bolster one another as they’re doing it.</p><p>To date, Noah has released 2 EPs, 18 singles, and 4 promotional singles. Last January, for Noah’s birthday, Miley took to Instagram to showcase several of Noah’s singles in honour of her sister. But what garnered the most interest about Miley’s selection was her decision to share the artwork from “Love or Die,” Noah’s 2018 song with her now-ex, rapper <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/what-does-noah-cyrus-think-of-lil-xan-becoming-a-father.html/\" target=\"_blank\">Lil Xan</a>. As a caption, Cyrus wrote, “Controversial to still love this song? Might delete later.” </p><p>As the story goes, Noah dated Lil Xan from June to September 2018, and it was a complete hot mess of a drama within weeks, what with accusations of cheating flying both ways, and Lil Xan’s anxiety and drug use being far too much to handle. Miley has always <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyCAcT85lS8&amp;ab_channel=HollywoodLife\" target=\"_blank\">stood up for her sis</a>, claiming that Lil Xan <em>did</em> cheat on Noah, and then tried to turn it around by accusing her of the same. “It's sickening the way he’s trying to manipulate Noah and mess with her mind,” she said, adding that she wanted to help her sister get through the breakup, as that she's better off without him.</p><p>When it comes to her sister's solo singing career, Miley has <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/miley-cyrus-noah-music-industry\" target=\"_blank\">expressed real joy</a>. “She didn’t even tell me that this was really happening all of a sudden, which I think she wanted to really do it on her own. So I’m really proud of her that she did. I think she really didn’t involve me as much… I think she just wanted to get out on her own two feet without this having anything to do with me.” </p><p>In fact, Miley even <a href=\"https://www.thethings.com/miley-noah-cyrus-relationship/#:~:text=2%20The%20Sisters%20Are%208,makes%20no%20difference%20for%20them!\" target=\"_blank\">got on TikTok</a> and did some dancing to promote Noah's song “The End of Everything,”<em> </em>and Noah has done the same for Miley on multiple occasions. These are sisters who build each other up and offer support—in matters of heartbreak and music alike. </p><p>Not to mention, Miley never took her sister’s expressions of hardship as the youngest in their family personally: she’s wise enough to know that it’s not about her. Impressively, these two have managed to be honest about their less than sunny feelings while still nurturing a close bond. I’d go one further and say that honesty makes you vulnerable, which in turn strengthens any bond that's worth having.</p><p>Miley, having experienced life on the road as a musician for many years now, has said that Noah’s budding career has made her more relatable. “Now having someone that really understands how hard it can be when you’re away from home for a month, me and my little sister have a new bond over that,” <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/miley-cyrus-noah-music-industry\" target=\"_blank\">she said</a>.</p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-custom1\" id=\"cite2\">She loves me more now that she knows I do something. She always thought I do nothing and that I went to put two wigs on.<br /><cite>Miley Cyrus</cite></blockquote><p>Now, it seems, that Noah gets firsthand how much time and energy goes into being famous, the sisters’ empathy for one another has only grown.<br /></p><p>Back in October, Noah took to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CGyumgmJY6z/?utm_source=ig_embed\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> to express how excited she was to have included a song with her big sister among the tracks on <em>The End of Everything</em>. “No one knows how happy and excited Miley and I are to be releasing something TOGETHER for our VERY FIRST TIME!!!! And it’s NOT the last,” she wrote. </p><p>This collaboration is the ultimate result of a strong relationship among sisters who are both doing their darnedest to grow and evolve together, rather than separately.</p><p><strong>More inspiring celebrities:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/2020/11/25/miley-cyrus-cody-simpson-breakup-realization/\">After Yet Another Breakup, Miley Cyrus Finally Realized Her One Mistake</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/2020/11/25/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-relationship-proves-growth-maturity/\">Why Taylor Swift’s Secret Relationship With Joe Alwyn Proves She Finally Learned Her Lesson</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/2020/11/23/jennifer-aniston-john-mayer-breakup-comments-friendship/\">Here’s what Jennifer Aniston Did When Her Ex John Mayer Attacked Her</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/2020/10/15/jennifer-lopez-marc-anthony-divorce-realization/\">What Finally Convinced Jennifer Lopez That She Needed A Divorce From Marc Anthony</a></li></ul>",

It's a living, breathing network of connections and shared experiences. While it's usually defined as “a group of people living in the same place or having a particular characteristic in common,” true community runs much deeper than that.\n</p><p><strong>Diversity</strong></p><p>\n\tIt doesn’t matter how different we are. What matters in building a community is the desire to live in a peaceful and caring environment, despite all our differences.Good Neighbors<br />\n</p><p><strong>Good Neighbors</strong><br /></p><p>\n\tWhen searching for a new place to call home, we hope to stumble upon neighbors who can transform a neighborhood into something meaningful. We all need to be surrounded by people who genuinely care for the well-being of others. Only this type of people can create a community that is more than just a bunch of individuals living next to each other.\n</p><p><strong>It Starts with One</strong><br /></p><p>\n\tBuilding a strong community starts with individual contributions, no matter how small. As long as you are kind and willing to help others in need, you’ll be a great community member. In exchange, your community will give you a sense of belonging and the feeling that you are never alone.\n</p><h2>Here are 35 quotes on what makes communities special — community service, coming together, engagement, involvement, and support</h2><h3>Quotes about community coming together</h3><blockquote id=\"cite0\">One of the marvelous things about community is that it enables us to welcome and help people in a way we couldn't as individuals.<br /><cite>JEAN VANIER</cite></blockquote><blockquote id=\"cite1\">There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about.<br /><cite>MARGARET J.

The show was enormously popular and put Chappelle on the map. <em>Chappelle’s Show</em> was scheduled to have a third season after the success of the first two seasons but that never happened. </p><h4>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/why-dave-chappelle-walked-away-from-50-million-dollars/\">Why Dave Chappelle Walked Away From $50 Million Dollars …</a></h4><p>Instead, Chappelle famously walked away from the series and a $50 million paycheck. He abruptly left during production in 2006, effectively breaking his contract with Comedy Central. He was reportedly unhappy with the direction the show had taken and needed to step away.</p><p>But there has been one person who has been with the comedian through it all and that's his wife, Elaine.</p><h2>Dave and Elaine Chappelle Prioritize Family Over Money</h2><p>In an interview with <em><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20050516081506/https:/www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1061415,00.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Time</a></em>, Chappelle spoke about moving to Ohio and walking away from his show, saying, \"Coming here, I don't have the distractions of fame.

Others thought it was a mental health issue that led comedian Dave Chappelle to walk away from it all. That wasn’t the case at all.

(Dave converted to Islam in 1991.) She grew up in Brooklyn and according to various sources, once planned to become a professional chef. Dave and Elaine Chappelle met more than 20 years ago, so she would have been in her 20s. After meeting and falling in love with Dave Chappelle, Elaine chose to devote herself to raising the couple’s three children.</p><h2><strong>How Did Dave Chappelle and Elaine Meet?</strong></h2><div><strong><br /></strong></div><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"dave with his arm around his wife elaine chappell\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"2ca0d\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/dave-with-his-arm-around-his-wife-elaine-chappell.png?id=55368800&amp;width=980\" />\n<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Goalcast Archive</small></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"></figure><p>During an interview with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81yCzWkt8uM\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Howard Stern</a> in the early 2000s, Dave Chappelle revealed that he met his then-girlfriend Elaine Mendoza in Brooklyn and at the time he said she was pregnant with his baby. He said that he was immediately interested in her, but she took some time to get to know Dave before committing to the relationship. </p><h4>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/dave-chappelle-talks-worst-experience-video/\">Dave Chappelle Talks About His Worst Experience</a></h4><p>He also revealed that she was Filipino, which led Stern and his co-host Robin Quivers to make some distasteful jokes about Asian stereotypes. Up until this point Dave Chappelle had been a regular guest on Stern’s show and even credited the exposure Stern gave him with helping his career. After they made those so-called jokes about the future Elaine Chappelle, he has continually refused to ever appear on Stern’s show again. Though he publicly says it’s because the show <a href=\"https://www.thethings.com/why-dave-chappelle-wont-do-the-howard-stern-show-again/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tapes too early in the morning</a>, it feels like he's showing where his loyalties lie – with his wife Elaine Chappelle.</p><h2><strong>Elaine is Dave Chappelle’s Support System</strong></h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"dave chappelle during a comedy routine\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8e22c\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/dave-chappelle-during-a-comedy-routine.png?id=55368803&amp;width=980\" />\n<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Goalcast Archive</small></p>\n<p><br /></p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"></figure><p>Dave and Elaine Chappelle have a strong marriage that has lasted more than two decades so far.

And they're still culturally relevant. The 2023 film <em>Anyone But You</em> had Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell recreate the Jack and Rose \"leaning over the deck of the Titanic\" scene we'll never forget.</p><hr /><h3>Their First Kiss on the set of the Titanic</h3><br /><img alt=\"titanic movie cover\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"cabc4\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/titanic-movie-cover.jpg?id=55368691&amp;width=1200&amp;height=800&amp;quality=50&amp;coordinates=0%2C206%2C0%2C386\" /><p>Meeting on the set of <em>Titanic</em> in 1997, DiCaprio and Winslet instantly clicked amidst the gruelling seven-month shoot. Their chemistry was palpable, but both actors have insisted that their bond was purely platonic. Winslet once shared that while her friends were swooning over DiCaprio, to her, he was just “silly old Leo.” This early connection started a friendship that would endure the test of time and Hollywood’s pressures.</p><h3>Oscar Buzz and Romance Buzz</h3><br /><img alt=\"Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio at the Golden Globe Awards\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a7acb\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/kate-winslet-and-leonardo-dicaprio-at-the-golden-globe-awards.jpg?id=52499936&amp;width=1200&amp;height=800&amp;quality=50&amp;coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C262\" /><p>Their friendship has only blossomed over the years, punctuated by countless public appearances that left fans buzzing. Take the 1998 Golden Globes, for instance—Leo and Kate’s camaraderie was on full display as they cheered each other on, despite the endless swirl of romantic rumors. This pattern of mutual support and affectionate displays has persisted, proving that true friendship not only survives but thrives under the bright lights of Hollywood’s spotlight.</p><h3>Reuniting On The Silver Screen</h3><br /><img alt=\"Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet smiling on a couch in Revolutionary Road\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d48e4\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/leonardo-dicaprio-and-kate-winslet-smiling-on-a-couch-in-revolutionary-road.jpg?id=51945688&amp;width=980\" /><p>In 2008, DiCaprio and Winslet reunited on screen for <em>Revolutionary Road</em>, a film about a disintegrating marriage. Despite the intense and somewhat uncomfortable scenes, especially with Winslet’s then-husband Sam Mendes directing, their chemistry was as electric as ever. Winslet later reflected on their effortless ability to fall back into sync, likening it to muscle memory. This reunion showcased their incredible acting skills and highlighted the depth of their enduring friendship.</p><h3>She Thanked Leo (Before Her Husband)!</h3><br /><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span><p>At the 2009 Golden Globe Awards, Cameron Diaz and Mark Wahlberg presented the award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Drama to Kate Winslet for her stunning performance in <em>Revolutionary Road</em>. Winslet, overwhelmed with emotion, took the stage and apologized to the other nominees before expressing her disbelief at winning a second award that night.<br /></p><p>In her heartfelt speech, she thanked the Hollywood Foreign Press, her longtime agents, writer Richard Yates, the film’s cast and crew, the producers, the hair and makeup department, her dialect coach, and, notably, her co-star Leonardo DiCaprio before her husband and the film's director, Sam Mendes. Among the nominees were heavyweights like Anne Hathaway, Angelina Jolie, Meryl Streep, and Kristin Scott Thomas.</p><p>Winslet made sure to acknowledge her longtime friend and <em>Revolutionary Road</em> co-star, saying, \"Leo, I'm so happy I can stand here and tell you how much I love you and how much I've loved you for 13 years. Your performance in this film is nothing short of spectacular.\"</p><h3>Leo Walked Kate Down The Aisle</h3><br /><img alt=\"Moet &amp; Chandon Inside Ballroom at the 64th Annual Golden Globe Awards\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"35e51\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/moet-chandon-inside-ballroom-at-the-64th-annual-golden-globe-awards.jpg?id=52499919&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;quality=50&amp;coordinates=0%2C33%2C0%2C1771\" /><p>In 2012, during a secret ceremony in New York, it was rumored that Leonardo DiCaprio gave Kate Winslet away at her wedding to Ned Rocknroll (born Abel Smith). This touching gesture demonstrated the depth of their bond, with DiCaprio standing by his friend’s side during one of the most significant moments of her life. This act of friendship showcased the unwavering support and love they have for each other, further cementing their status as one of Hollywood’s most beloved duos.</p><h3>And The Oscar Goes To...</h3><br /><img alt=\"Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, 88th Annual Academy Awards - Backstage And Audience\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"21d77\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/leonardo-dicaprio-and-kate-winslet-88th-annual-academy-awards-backstage-and-audience.jpg?id=52468845&amp;width=980\" /><p>Who can forget the 2016 Oscars when DiCaprio, finally nominated for his role in <em>The Revenant</em>, surprised Winslet on the red carpet? The reunion sparked joy and nostalgia for fans, reminding everyone of their timeless bond that began with <em>Titanic</em>.</p><p>During DiCaprio’s acceptance speech, Winslet couldn’t hold back her tears. As he spoke about the importance of protecting our planet, the camera caught Winslet’s emotional reaction, proving just how much his success meant</p><h3>They Didn't See Each Other For 3 Years!</h3><br /><img alt=\"Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio's emotional reunion during the pandemic\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"10f45\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/kate-winslet-and-leonardo-dicaprio-s-emotional-reunion-during-the-pandemic.jpg?id=52500009&amp;width=980\" /><p>The COVID-19 pandemic posed a significant challenge to their friendship, as travel restrictions kept them apart. Winslet described their emotional reunion after nearly three years as tear-filled and overwhelming, emphasizing how much they missed each other. “I couldn’t stop crying,” Winslet confessed, illustrating the profound connection they share. This reunion underscored the strength of their bond, one that thrives even in challenging times.</p><p>Their friendship was once again in the spotlight during the release of <em>Titanic's</em> 4K Ultra HD edition, where Winslet reminisced about their early days on set. She described young DiCaprio as a magnetic presence, full of energy and freedom, qualities that made working with him a delightful experience. Winslet’s reflections remind us of the joyful and enduring nature of their bond.</p><h3>Nearly 30 Years of Friendship</h3><br /><img alt=\"The 66th Annual Golden Globe Awards - ET Red Carpet Arrivals\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"62c74\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/the-66th-annual-golden-globe-awards-et-red-carpet-arrivals.jpg?id=52499993&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;quality=50&amp;coordinates=0%2C17%2C0%2C545\" /><p>Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet’s friendship is a testament to the enduring power of genuine human connection amidst the glitz and glamour of Hollywood. Their story, filled with shared memories, mutual respect, and unwavering support, continues to inspire fans worldwide. In an industry where relationships can often be fleeting, their bond stands out as a heartwarming example of true friendship.</p><p>From their early days on the <em>Titanic</em> set to walking each other down the aisle and supporting each other’s career milestones, DiCaprio and Winslet's friendship reminds us that childhood friends never get old. As Winslet once said, “We’re bonded for life,” a sentiment that perfectly captures the deep and abiding connection they share.</p>",

The city had a number of apothecaries with soda fountains, as well as confectioners serving countless carbonated concoctions—some claiming to cure a variety of ailments, and others simply providing customers with something sweet and refreshing to drink.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enter the nectar soda. The flavor is a combination of vanilla and bitter almond, and the drink is pastel pink in color—a nod to the hue of almond flowers, according to </span><a href=\"https://dannwoellertthefoodetymologist.wordpress.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dann Woellert</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a Cincinnati food historian, etymologist, and the author of </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cincinnati-Candy-History-American-Palate/dp/1467137952\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cincinnati Candy: A Sweet History</span></em></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Nicknamed the “</span><a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/hnpcincinnatienquirershell/historical-newspapers/august-2-1942-page-55-108/docview/1882746511/sem-2?accountid=39387\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">drink of the gods</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” the bitter almond flavor of nectar soda balances out what would otherwise be overly sweet vanilla, creating an addictive taste that grows on you with each sip. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nectar sodas have been served in Cincinnati since at least the late 1870s, though, like many iconic foods and beverages, its precise origins are murky. The only other U.S. city to embrace nectar sodas was New Orleans, but unlike Cincinnati, the tradition fizzled out in the Big Easy in the mid-20th century. Plus, Woellert says that the Queen City popularized them first. “They were served in Cincinnati nearly a decade before New Orleans,” he says.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the Cincinnati nectar soda has multiple origin stories, each crediting a different pharmacist or confectioner, Woellert has concluded that </span><a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/hnpcincinnatienquirershell/historical-newspapers/april-13-1947-page-98-151/docview/1882885311/sem-2?accountid=39387\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Mullane</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> created the flavor after traveling to Quebec City to learn the art of confectionery from a prominent Canadian candymaker. He began serving nectar sodas in his confectionery shop in downtown Cincinnati in the late 1870s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, why did the nectar soda end up in Cincinnati and New Orleans, of all places? Wollert suspects that the bitter almond and vanilla flavor was used by the French Acadians who settled in both Quebec City and New Orleans.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though nectar sodas aren’t as common as they were in the early 20th century, when they could be found at countless confectioneries and pharmacy soda fountains across Cincinnati, they’re still served at establishments throughout the city and the surrounding area. Nectar sodas have been on the menu at ice cream and chocolate shop </span><a href=\"https://www.aglamesis.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aglamesis Brothers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since it opened in Cincinnati in 1908, if not shortly thereafter. That’s according to company president and CEO Randy Young, who is also a third-generation family member. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s unclear when nectar sodas were added to the </span><a href=\"https://digital.cincinnatilibrary.org/digital/collection/p16998coll32/id/2220/rec/19\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">menu</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at </span><a href=\"https://www.graeters.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graeter’s</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a Cincinnati ice cream and chocolate shop that opened in 1870 and now has locations throughout the city and the Midwest, but Chip Graeter, chief of retail operations and a fourth-generation family member, says that they were especially popular throughout the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a </span><a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/hnpcincinnatienquirershell/historical-newspapers/january-28-1947-page-2-26/docview/1882876222/sem-2?accountid=39387\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">January 28, 1947 article</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cincinnati Enquirer</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Tom Moore, the head of the soda department at Dow Drug Store—which operated 32 soda fountains throughout the metropolitan area at that time—said that “nectar is one of the most popular flavors in all of their stores, and has been for many years.” Five years prior, </span><a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/hnpcincinnatienquirershell/historical-newspapers/august-16-1942-page-63-99/docview/1882739776/sem-2?accountid=39387\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow ran an ad</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the same newspaper which read: “Be glad you live in Cincinnati, the only place in the country where you can enjoy a Dow double-dip nectar soda.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Originally, nectar syrup was made by combining half-and-half or milk with water, bitter almond extract, vanilla extract and red food coloring. While Aglamesis eventually switched to a dairy-free shelf-stable syrup, Graeter's recipe has never changed—it still contains milk and needs to be refrigerated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Aglamesis and Graeter’s make nectar soda by mixing nectar syrup with a dollop of whipped cream, adding a scoop or two of vanilla ice cream, then topping it off with some soda water and more whipped cream.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Young says that nectar sodas are most popular with older adults, they’re also a hit with members of younger generations who try them. “People who grew up with them still love them today,” Graeter says. “We still make them in all of our stores, but they're not nearly as popular today as they once were, simply because milkshakes and smoothies have taken over.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Young, there is a commercially available descendant of </span><a href=\"https://www.coca-cola.com/us/en/brands/barq-s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the nectar soda</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “Commercial soda companies like Barqs and others came out with their version of cream soda—a bright pink soda—which got its flavoring from nectar soda,” he explains.</span></p>",

In reality, many people invest in continuing education and are then stuck paying off student loans for a large chunk of their lives.\n</p><p>\n\tThat’s what happened to Jasmin Ford, a nurse in Chicago. She was dealing with a large debt and struggling to pay it off by working two jobs. Then, something incredible happened to her – the debt vanished. Here's how it all went down.\n</p><h3>A Familiar Story: Graduating With Debt</h3><br /><img alt=\"jasmin ford and her son\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"12dcd\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/jasmin-ford-and-her-son.png?id=54969765&amp;width=980\" /><p><br /></p><h3></h3><br /><p>When Ford received her bachelor’s degree in 2011, she was the first person in her <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/family-quotes/\" target=\"_self\">family</a> to graduate from college. She was proud and didn’t stop there, returning to school to get her nursing degree.</p><p>It was tough, especially since Ford didn’t have any family assistance to help her to pay for things. In order to afford necessities like food and rent, plus her tuition, she relied on student loans, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Living/bank-surprises-single-mom-paying-off-150k-student/story?id=59797289\" target=\"_blank\">reports </a><em><a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Living/bank-surprises-single-mom-paying-off-150k-student/story?id=59797289\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ABC News</a>.</em></p><p>“I could not foresee when I’d be able to pay it off,” Ford told the publication. “I just knew this was going to be a part of my life as long as I was alive unless there was some significant change.”</p><h3>Arrival of Surprising News</h3><br /><p>At 30 years old, Ford was working nearly every day at two jobs and providing for her two-year-old son, Caleb. She didn’t see an end in sight, but then out of nowhere, Fifth Third Bank contacted her and told her it was paying off her $150,000 loans, free and clear.</p><blockquote><strong></strong>“I still can’t find the words [...] I’m off work again today, and I’m just sort of pacing around and restless because I know my life is going to change.” -Jasmin Ford</blockquote><p>The bank had selected Ford after she was chosen to participate in a documentary about student loan debt. She thought the crew was coming to her house to shoot some extra footage when they dropped the news.</p><p>“The documentary in itself was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” she continued. “I’m a South Side of Chicago nurse and I have a kid, that in itself is not that exciting, and I got to be in a documentary and I met some amazing people on the way.”</p><h3>A Life-Changing Moment</h3><br /><p>Ford was surprised by the amazing gesture, and knows it is a game changer for herself and her son.</p><p>“His life will be totally different,” she said. “I’m so happy and so proud that I’m able to offer that to him more than anything else because he deserves it.”</p><p>Looking forward, Ford is excited to pay it forward with her nursing degree, but also just to have more freedom, both <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/mental-health-quotes/\" target=\"_self\">mentally</a> and physically. She wants to spend less time hustling and more time with her family, all while embracing what comes next.</p><p>“I can open myself to more experiences, opportunities and just be able to sit and be with my thoughts and be able to pursue what it is I came to do,” she added.</p><h3>A Lesson in Perseverance</h3><br /><p>Ford’s story is a perfect example of the fact that while there’s something to be said for pursuing your <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/goals-quotes/\" target=\"_self\">dreams</a> and working hard, the road to success isn’t always easy. In fact, sometimes it feels completely riddled with obstacles that may make you want to give up.</p><p>But sometimes, good things really do happen to good people. Ford wasn’t expecting this level of help, but she knows just how game-changing it is.</p><p>Her story inspires many to hold onto hope and keep stepping forward even when the path is uphill because, in the end, it will somehow work out.</p><p>We just need to hold onto faith and, when times get tough, remember to keep pushing through.</p><h3></h3><br /><p><strong>More from Goalcast:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/man-buys-bank-that-refused-loan-18-years-ago/\" target=\"_self\">Man Buys The Bank That Refused Him A Loan When He Was Broke 18 Years Ago</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/nurse-lottery-mansion-omaze/\" target=\"_self\">Homeless Student Nurse Couch Surfs to Survive–but Christmas Came Early When She Wins $6M Home in Lottery</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/debt-community-facebook-mom-jeans/\" target=\"_self\">Struggling Single Mom With Staggering Debt Decides to Make a Change — And Bring Others With Her</a></li></ul><p></p><div class=\"rm-shortcode\">\n<div class=\"jwplayer-media\" id=\"botr_vhW9ib0F_rfvUMj7m_div\">\n<img class=\"jwplayer-media-preview\" src=\"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/vhW9ib0F-1920.jpg\" />\n</div>\n\n</div><br /><p></p><p>\n<br />\n</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><br />\n</h2>",

That’s particularly true for some teens, who work these jobs for part-time <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/how-to-save-money/\" target=\"_blank\">money</a> and are often <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/adult-bullying-is-real-heres-how-to-handle-it/\" target=\"_blank\">bullied</a> by adults. Perhaps that’s why people are applauding these teen girls for the way they expertly handled an over-the-top customer.</p><hr /><h3>An Angry Customer</h3><br /><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\">\n<div style=\"padding: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;\">\n<div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\">\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C883KFHuHkU/\" style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_top\">See on Instagram</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote><p>It was a tough day for employees at Keke’s Snow Balls in Texas when an angry woman approached the window. She had placed a pickup order for a snow cone and because of a shift change, the snow cone wasn’t ready. Two days later, the customer came back and demanded a refund of $6.</p><p>A girl named Victoria was working the counter and listened to the woman’s complaints. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CPIa1OpxEM\" target=\"_blank\">According to <em>Inside Edition</em></a>, it was immediately clear this woman didn’t want to resolve things in the right way, and was trying to pick a fight. Another employee named Kaeley overheard it all.</p><p>“I was just listening in the back and, eventually, I could just hear she’s angry the whole time. So I was like, clearly she just wants to have a problem,” Kaeley recalled to the publication. “And I’m not about that, so I was like, ‘Okay let me just go give her $6 and we can move on, move past this.’ It was $6.”</p><h3>An Unexpected Turn</h3><br /><p>At that point, the situation should have been resolved. However, Kaeley noticed the sign outside the window had fallen over during the dispute. So, she opened the window to fix it. That’s when the woman came by, slapped the sign out of the 17-year-old girl’s hand, and called her a derogatory name.</p><p>“M’am, please don’t act like that. You’re a grown woman,” Kaeley responded in a video that the restaurant then <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@kekessnowballs/video/7385726944513428767\" target=\"_blank\">posted to TikTok</a>. “You’re a grown woman. I’m 17. Get out of here. Don’t come back. Don’t come back. We don’t need your business.”</p><p>“I was scared and very confused,” Victoria added. “I wasn’t understanding what was going on.”</p><h3>A Brilliant Online Reaction</h3><br /><p>After the owner posted the video online, it went viral and many people reached out to support the girls for their perfect reaction to the customer.</p><p>“People were traveling to come and see us from hours away,” the owner, Kyle, told <em>Inside Edition</em>. “We had people reaching out to us on TikTok asking how to tip the girls. We even had people going and leaving Google reviews that haven’t even been to the shop, saying they’re so proud of the girls and how they dealt with it,” he continued. </p><p>Kyle explained that he posted the video to remind everyone that the employees behind the counter are people, too. Adults, in particular, should try to remember that oftentimes, these are kids working to save up for cars, school, and other big life steps.</p><p>“Mistakes happen, but for you to go up and act like that as an adult, my whole point in uploading that video is to simply remind us all that we need to treat people better,” Kyle added.</p><p>\"I am proud of the way our supervisor handled the situation,\" he added in <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C883KFHuHkU/\" target=\"_blank\">the initial post</a>. \"We must strive for better behavior and respect in all interactions. It’s all about just being a kind person and approaching every situation with willingness to come to a good resolution.\"</p><h3>We Are All the Same</h3><br /><p>As Kyle himself said, mistakes happen and no one is perfect. But demanding <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/why-youre-perfect-just-as-you-are/\" target=\"_blank\">perfection</a> of others can be a very lonely way to live. Rather than getting upset over an honest mistake and making someone feel bad or yelling at them, lead with grace and understanding. Not only will you help someone else feel respected, but you’ll probably get a better result from the situation, too.</p><p>When life doesn’t go our way, it can be easy to overreact or blame someone else. But by remembering that mistakes happen and this too shall pass, we can all live a little more peacefully.</p><p>Many of us are in these jobs because we’re trying to provide for our families or ourselves and our futures. Going to work can be hard enough, so remember to thank those who help you in the customer service industry and to tip well when appropriate. After all, we all want to feel appreciated at work. </p>",

The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard ya hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. <strong><em>That's how winning is done! </em></strong>Now if you know what you're worth then go out and get what you're worth. But ya gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody! Cowards do that and that ain't you! You're better than that! I'm always gonna love you no matter what. No matter what happens. You're my son and you're my blood. You're the best thing in my life.

Yet for millions of people, purpose feels elusive, like some far-off destination, an epiphany waiting for divine intervention.</p><p>Narratives around living the life of your dreams can package purpose in a very set way, telling stories of a select few who were lucky enough to find their purpose, and never looked back.</p><p>All of these assumptions about purpose make it both intimidating and seemingly unattainable. Factor in cultural ideas of what purpose looks like — from starting a billion-dollar venture in Silicon Valley to living a life in service of the greater good — and you’ll likely be left feeling frustrated, or confused, about how to add purpose to your life.</p><p>Fortunately, these assumptions are misleading. Purpose is much easier to attain than it seems on the surface. And, thankfully, the Japanese concept of ikigai makes discovering your purpose practical. There’s no need to wait for a eureka moment, or yearn for the day purpose will arrive on your doorstep. With ikigai as your own personal Japanese secret, you can start taking deliberate steps to add purpose to your days and inhabit a more happy life. This article will show you how you can start your own personal ikigai journey. Let’s get started!</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-japanese-concept-of-ikigai\">What is the Japanese concept of Ikigai?</h2><p>The best translation for ikigai (pronounced “ee key guy”) is “a reason for being.” The term is formed from the Japanese words iki (life) and gai (worth or benefit).</p><p>Ikigai is central to Japanese culture, with its origin stretching all the way back to the Heian period, a period of classical Japanese history lasting between the years 794 and 1185.</p><p>American researcher Dan Buettner, who presented the popular Ted Talk How to Live to 100, identified ikigai as one of the main factors for greater longevity in Japan. Buettner popularized the concept in the West in the early 2000s.</p><p>Long before then, Japanese psychiatrist Mieko Kamiya, the Mother of Ikigai, wrote one of the most popular modern-day books on the philosophy, Ikigai-ni-Tsuite (What Makes Our Life Worth Living), in 1966. This was around the time early positive psychology was born. Psychologists such as Abraham Maslow, Carl Rogers, and Viktor Frankl shifted the paradigm of psychology away from pathology, and towards what makes for a fulfilling, meaningful life.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Maslow\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"11c35\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/maslow.jpg?id=51945982&amp;width=980\" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"moving-towards-a-more-meaningful-life\">Moving towards a more meaningful life</h3><p>Kamiya herself compared ikigai to Frankl’s approach to meaning. Both were well-versed in how suffering could lead to personal growth. Frankl from his time spent in concentration camps during the Holocaust, and Kamiya worked with leprosy patients. Kamiya described ikigai as:</p><p>“Ikigai means ‘power necessary for one to live in this world, happiness to be alive, benefit, effectiveness.’ When we try to translate it into English, German, French etc, it seems that there is no other way to define it other than ‘worth living’ or ‘value or meaning to live’. Thus, compared to philosophical theoretical concepts, the word ikigai shows us how ambiguous the Japanese language is, but because of this it has an effect of reverberation and amplitude.”</p><p>She acknowledged that “the fact that this word exists should indicate that the goal to live, its meaning and value within the daily life of the Japanese soul has been problematized.” In other words, the word exists because modern-living, to some degree, has disconnected people from their innate sense of purpose, or their soul’s calling.</p><p>Kamiya further defines ikigai into two categories — the source of ikigai, and the state of mind someone feels when connected to the source (ikigai-kan). For Kamiya, ikigai-kan is linked to Frankl’s concept of meaning. In life, a person’s mission is to connect to their mission. Failure to do so can result in depression or anxiety.</p><p>In order to become clear on this mission, Kamiya suggested two questions:</p><ol><li>What is my existence for?</li><li>What is the purpose of my existence?</li></ol><h3 id=\"gaining-clarity\">Gaining Clarity</h3><p>Once clarity is gained, ikigai becomes the North Star that you are guided to. The journey itself is what’s important, not the final destination. Those who are moving towards that North Star experience a sense of fulfillment, ikigai-kan.</p><p>Kamiya was careful to note those pursuing their purpose weren’t always distinguished people — someone can be in service to ikigai when raising children, teaching at schools, or working in medicine. What’s most important is that a person is able to connect to their purpose, and honor it, in whichever way is unique to them.</p><p>For Kamiya, the process of clarifying and honoring their soul’s calling is the discovery of a new theme of existence. For many people, this process could unfold during a spiritual awakening, where their motivations radically transform. For others, it could be a slight, but noticeable change of direction.</p><h2 id=\"ikigai-and-maslow-s-hierarchy-of-needs\">Ikigai and Maslow’s hierarchy of needs</h2><p>In addition to parallels between Frankl’s work on the value of meaning, Kamiya also discovered that to experience ikigai-kan, someone must first have several personal needs met. The result is a similar model of thinking to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, which outlines the journey of growth and self-actualization.</p><p>The needs Kamiya identified are:</p><p>The need for life satisfaction<br />The need for change and growth<br />The need for a bright future<br />The need for resonance<br />The need for freedom<br />The need for self-actualization<br />The need for meaning and value</p><p>These closely resemble Maslow’s pyramid of physiological needs, safety needs, love and belonging, esteem, self-actualization, and self-transcendence (the often forgotten additional layer). It’s worth keeping in mind, though, that Maslow noted for some, lower levels can be transcended by higher values, such as creativity being more important than safety needs or esteem.</p><p>The same can be said of ikigai — if your mission or purpose is something greater than you, it’s likely that it can overshadow other personal needs and contribute to well being.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-ikigai-important-for-a-fulfilling-life\">Why is Ikigai important for a fulfilling life?</h2><p>As Buettner discovered, meaning is one of the most influential factors in living a long and healthy life, both for younger generations and those that are older. Buettner has researched so-called Blue Zones, the locations where people lived for longer and enjoyed greater wellbeing.</p><p>Five locations Buettner discovered were Okinawa, Japan; Sardinia, Italy; Nicoya, Costa Rica; Ikaria, Greece, and Loma Linda, California. He noticed that these five locations placed a lot of emphasis on meaning and purpose.</p><p>This has been backed up by multiple studies. A 2014 UCL-led study of 9,000 people with an average age of 65 found that those with a greater sense of meaning and purpose were 30 percent less likely to die in the following eight-year period. More recently in 2019, a study of 7,000 people over the age of 50 found “life purpose was significantly associated with all-cause mortality.” So much so, the lowest scorers of the study were twice as likely to have died than those with the highest scores five years later.</p><h3 id=\"the-power-of-ikigai\">The power of ikigai</h3><p>Noriyuki Nakashi, from Osaka University, explains the power of ikigai as:</p><p>“Ikigai is personal: it reflects the inner self of an individual and expresses that faithfully.<br />Ikigai, which is the highest level of desire, may be considered to be essentially the process of cultivating one’s inner potential and that which makes one's life significant, a universal human experience we all wish to achieve.”</p><p>Purpose gives you a deeper reason for living, it makes your life significant. As noted by thinkers such as Kamiya and Frankl, there is an interesting component to this — it appears, deep down, each of us has a purpose that we intuitively know and understand. Our mission is to listen to that calling and do all we can to honor it, in order to cultivate our inner potential.</p><p>Longevity is a byproduct of doing something right. Purpose gives you the energy and inspiration to pursue your goals, overcome struggle, and keep going when times are tough. It provides strong foundations of fulfillment and can give your life a new direction, not towards fleeting happiness, but towards things of high value. In the words of Oscar Wilde: “To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.”</p><h2 id=\"understanding-the-ikigai-chart-and-your-own-ikigai-journey\">Understanding the Ikigai chart and your own ikigai journey</h2><p>Are you ready for your mind to be blown by ikigai, the Japanese secret that so many swear by? For your understanding of ikigai to take a drastic u-turn into a new theme of existence? The ikigai venn diagram, shared by millions and rising to meme-like popularity on social media, isn’t linked to ikigai. Instead, it was an idea from Marc Winn, an entrepreneur and blogger who merged the idea of ikigai with a venn diagram of purpose.</p><p>Winn was introduced to the concept of ikigai and the ikigai diagram from Buettner’s Ted Talk. “I don’t know whether to laugh or cry,” he wrote in 2017, “less than an hour of my time has made more of a difference in the world than all my time put together.”</p><p>Winn acknowledges his own surprise that his idea, and the diagram, spiraled out of control. The diagram is shown below:</p><img alt=\"Ikigai: The True Meaning with Diagrams, Definitions, &amp; Myths | Sloww\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"52525\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/ikigai-the-true-meaning-with-diagrams-definitions-myths-sloww.jpg?id=51945986&amp;width=980\" /><p>While the venn diagram is incredibly useful, there’s one major downside — the true meaning of ikigai isn’t about making money. The diagram might be valuable in understanding how you can launch a career of meaning, but in many ways, it’s the result of ikigai running through the money-oriented worldview of the West.<br />In fact, a 2010 study of 2,000 people in Japan found that only a third saw work as their ikigai. In addition, the Japanese translation of life means both your lifespan, and everyday life. This leads to another possible misinterpretation — ikigai can be discovered in the simple, day-to-day joys of living, not a grandiose plan or life mission worthy of Hollywood fame. It’s a spectrum of joy, from the seemingly mundane to the miraculous, and everything between.</p><h2 id=\"the-five-pillars-of-ikigai\">The five pillars of ikigai</h2><p>So if the ikigai isn’t discovered through a venn diagram, how do you apply the concept to your life? In The Little Book of Ikigai, Japanese neuroscientist and author Ken Mogi offers a five-pillar framework. By following this framework, you’re able to cultivate the type of lifestyle that allows for the emergence of ikigai:</p><h3 id=\"pillar-one-start-small\">Pillar One: Start Small</h3><p>Discovering a new theme of existence begins with small steps. That could be as simple as making the inner commitment to start creating a life of enhanced purpose.</p><p>What changes could you make, today, to start that process? Is there a passion, or calling, that you sense on the periphery of your awareness? What could you do in order to start honoring that? Remember, purpose doesn’t have to be elaborate or grand.</p><p>Applying Kamiya’s work, you could journal and answer the two questions: what is my existence for? What is the purpose of my existence? Don’t think about it too much, just see what surfaces.</p><p>Additionally, consider what things in life are the source of ikigai, or when are the moments when you feel ikigai-kan. For me, writing is the source of both. Although now established as a writer, in the beginning, it started with a commitment to write a little every day.</p><h3 id=\"pillar-two-releasing-yourself\">Pillar Two: Releasing Yourself</h3><p>This pillar demonstrates how deep the philosophy of ikigai is, and its entanglement with other Eastern philosophies that have stood the test of time, such as Buddhism. </p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Buddhism\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"baf83\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/buddhism.jpg?id=51946000&amp;width=980\" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure><p>Releasing yourself means to let go of all the things in life you hold onto, that cause some form of suffering.</p><p>It’s similar to the Buddhist practices of non-attachment. Are you attached to your self-image, what other people think of you, or always thinking about a time you’ll finally be happy?</p><p>Releasing yourself requires accepting where you’re at, who you are, and the moment in front of you. It leads to a state of peaceful surrender, going with the flow, rather than grappling with life.</p><p>Ikigai is, after all, a practice of aligning with nature. “The greatest secret of the ikigai, ultimately, has to be the acceptance of oneself, no matter what kind of unique features one might happen to be born with,” Mogi writes.</p><h3 id=\"pillar-three-harmony-and-sustainability\">Pillar Three: Harmony and Sustainability</h3><p>This step is connected to your environment. Ikigai incorporates the people in our lives, our immediate community, the quality and sustainability of all living things we interact with.</p><p>As Mogi says, “A man is like a forest; individual and yet connected and dependent on others for growth.” Harmony and sustainability are both inner and outer experiences, reflected in your emotions, your thoughts, the way you interact with the world, the way you go about your work.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"a man is like a forest\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c07ba\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/a-man-is-like-a-forest.jpg?id=51945983&amp;width=980\" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure><p>Consider any area of life where there is disharmony. Perhaps you have a few relationships that cause friction, or you are pushing yourself to extremes, unable to sustain that approach to hustle culture for the long term. In what ways can you invite a more peaceful approach? How can you be the source of harmony, for yourself, and for the wider world around you?</p><p>That doesn’t have to mean being half-hearted in what you do, quite the opposite, as ikigai encourages commitment and passion in equal measure. But make sure not to fall into traps of seriousness, and keep an explorative, playful attitude to yourself, your relationships, your community, and your work.</p><h3 id=\"pillar-four-the-joy-of-little-things\">Pillar Four: The Joy of Little Things</h3><p>Ikigai is a comprehensive philosophy, as well as being an antidote to a lot of modern approaches to finding happiness through constant striving, or the craving for success or recognition.</p><p>Deeply embedded in the Japanese concept is finding joy in little things. Your morning coffee. A smile from a stranger. An unexpected spell of sunshine. A message from a friend you’ve not spoken to in a while. A delicious sip of energizing green tea. All of these are opportunities to enjoy small sparks of joy, sparks that pave the way for a life in honor of ikigai.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"green tea\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b96f5\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/green-tea.jpg?id=51945998&amp;width=980\" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure><p>As Kamiya notes, those dedicated to ikigai spend all their days in fulfillment. Yes, there might be a challenging process of realizing your calling, and adjusting your life to make sure you have supreme focus on fulfilling your potential. But ikigai isn’t about the end destination, it’s about smelling the flowers on the way.</p><p>The easiest way to do this is to look for gratitude in your life. What things bring you a sense of comfort? What in your life would you have never predicted or thought you’d be able to achieve? What have you overcome? Who adds laughter or who supports you? All of these reflections of gratitude support the feeling of ikigai-kan.</p><h3 id=\"h-pillar-five-being-in-the-here-and-now\">Pillar Five: Being in the Here and Now</h3><p>To reaffirm the intention of ikigai, and its link to mindfulness, the final pillar reminds us to be present. To pause. To become fully aware of what’s directly in front of us. To take things one step at a time, and notice when our minds get caught in the past, or jump ahead to the future. The more present you become, the richer life is, the more nourishing each moment, and the less fearful you become about uncertain futures.</p><p>The irony of trying to find happiness is that it keeps us always looking ahead, waiting for a moment to come. But as many Eastern philosophies have taught, that is an illusion. Only the present ever exists. And the more you’re able to truly arrive in the present moment, the more likely you will be to experience deeper fulfillment.</p><p>Ikigai is a philosophy that reminds us that, with a brief pause, a moment of gratitude for the small things, acceptance for who we are and where we’re at. Then you might end up finding purpose where you never expected it — right in front of you.</p><p>Right here, right now. </p><p><a href=\"https://positivepsychology.com/ikigai/\" target=\"_blank\">If you have any unanswered questions click here, and good luck on your journey!</a></p>",

The Trollhättan waterfalls have been used for hydropower and boat travel since the 19th century and the town is well known for its King Oscar's Bridge which overlooks the powerful Trollhättan Falls.</p>\n<p>Somewhere along the way, Swedish royalty began to memorialize their visits to the town by putting their signature on this large rock which sits just below the bridge. Many visiting monarchs and personages have carved their name into the rock, with the oldest entry dating back to 1754, when King Adolf Fredrik and Queen Louisa Ulrika first started the tradition.</p>\n<p>The exact reason why this particular rock was used is unknown, but it became known as the Kungsgrottan soon after, even though it is not even a proper cave or grotto. Today there are over a dozen royal signatures, including that of the current heir to the Swedish throne, Crown Princess Victoria, who left her mark on the Kungsgrottan in 2001. Perhaps the royals chose to carve their names there simply because the spot offers a beautiful view over the waterfalls.</p>\n<p>You can find the King's Cave right before Oscar Bridge, down a small flight of stairs.</p>",
