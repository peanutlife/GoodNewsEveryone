Here is when to harvest some common kharif crops:</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Rice: When around 80-85% of the grains have turned golden.</li>\n<li>Maize: When the husks are dry and the kernels are firm.</li>\n<li>Pulses: When most pods are dry and brittle.</li>\n<li>Cotton: When the bolls are fully open and dry, avoid picking damp bolls.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Harvesting kharif crops\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/27/harvesting-kharif-crops-2025-10-27-18-09-58.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Using the correct tools makes the harvesting process smoother and more efficient Photograph: </em><a href=\"https://www.agrifarming.in/kharif-and-rabi-crops-in-india-a-full-guide\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>(Agri Farming)</em></a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Watch your field closely during the final weeks. If in doubt, test-harvest a small patch and examine the grain or pod condition.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Use the right tools and equipment</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Using the correct tools <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/sustainability/sohan-naik-power-planet-solar-energy-startup-powering-rural-karnataka-communities-10516336\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">makes the harvesting process smoother</a> and more efficient. A sharp sickle or well-maintained harvesting tool can reduce damage to the crop and lower the risk of grain shattering or spillage. For larger farms or crops like paddy and maize, mechanised options such as combine harvesters can save time and significantly reduce labour costs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Regardless of the method, it is important to avoid using worn or blunt tools, as they tend to damage plants and increase the chance of post-harvest losses.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Avoid leaving crops on damp ground</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After cutting, harvested crops should never be left directly on wet or muddy ground. Moisture at this stage can quickly lead to fungal growth, rotting, or contamination. Instead, place harvested produce on clean mats, tarpaulins, or raised platforms to keep them dry and safe.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If there is any risk of unexpected rainfall, cover the crops with breathable materials such as jute or straw. Keeping the produce dry during this stage is essential for maintaining quality.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. Dry the crop properly before storage</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moisture is one of the main causes of <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/467095/solar-dryer-based-business/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">post-harvest spoilage</a>. Once the crops are gathered, they must be dried thoroughly before they are stored. Sun-drying is the most accessible method. Spread the grains in thin layers on clean surfaces and turn them regularly to allow even drying.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For most grains, a moisture content of around 12 to 14 per cent is ideal for safe storage. Drying directly on bare earth should be avoided, as it can introduce dust, stones, and other impurities into the crop.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Harvesting kharif crops\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/27/harvesting-kharif-crops-2025-10-27-18-16-48.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Moisture is one of the main causes of post-harvest spoilage Photograph: <a href=\"https://www.cropin.com/blogs/kharif-crop/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(Cropin)</a></em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">5. Store in clean and ventilated spaces</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once drying is complete, storage becomes the next priority. Use clean, dry, and well-ventilated spaces to keep the harvest safe. Bags of grain should be stacked on wooden pallets or raised platforms to prevent direct contact with the floor, which often retains moisture. You can use gunny bags or jute sacks, as they allow air to circulate while keeping the produce contained.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The storage area should be regularly inspected for signs of pests, insects, or rodents. Easy steps such as sealing cracks, using natural repellents, or occasional fumigation can <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/youth/young-innovators/sharanya-mehta-class-12-student-decision-support-system-irrigation-app-rural-farmers-10504004\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">protect your crop from damage</a> over time.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">6. Transport crops carefully and without delay</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Transporting the crop to storage facilities or the market should not be delayed once harvesting and drying are complete. Use clean, covered carts or vehicles to prevent exposure to dust, heat, or rain during transit. Avoid overloading, as this can crush grains or damage pods.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If immediate transport is not possible, store the produce temporarily in a sheltered and dry area until arrangements can be made. Establishing safe transport helps maintain both the quality and quantity of the crop.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">7. Clean and sort before selling</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before crops are sent to market or stored long-term, they should be cleaned and sorted. Remove broken grains, debris, and any foreign material. Sorting the produce by size, shape, or colour not only improves its appearance but also increases its value in the market.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Harvesting kharif crops\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/27/harvesting-kharif-crops-2025-10-27-18-22-09.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Harvesting kharif crops requires attention to detail, good timing, and careful handling Photograph: </em><a href=\"https://www.agrifarming.in/kharif-and-rabi-crops-in-india-a-full-guide\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>(Agri Farming)</em></a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Well-graded,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/247857/agritech-sumit-sheoran-sudhanshu-rai-startup-fyllo-bengaluru-agriculture-farming-water-conservation-success-story-him16/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">clean produce attracts better prices</a> and guarantees a good reputation among buyers. Proper packaging, using clean and intact bags, is also important for protecting the crop during handling and sale.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">8. Keep an eye on the weather</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Towards the end of the monsoon, the weather can be unpredictable. Unseasonal rains or early winter showers can harm crops that are still in the field or left out to dry. Regularly checking local forecasts can help you plan your harvesting days better.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When rain is expected, it may be wise to harvest in smaller batches or focus on the most mature sections of the field first. Keeping plastic sheets or covers ready can also be useful in case of <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/439835/saidevi-sanjeeviraja-thicket-tales-nature-walks-for-school-children-in-bengaluru/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sudden weather changes</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Harvesting kharif crops requires attention to detail, good timing, and careful handling. From choosing the right time to harvest to proper drying, storage, and transport, every step contributes to preserving the crop&rsquo;s value.</p>",

He filled his truck with diesel and topped up with petrol. Then he entered the station and ordered a couple of iced coffees. When he went to pay, things went sideways.</p><p>Crawley had transferred all his <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/money-quotes/\">money</a> to a new bank account the night before and realized he didn’t have his new bank card on him. He tried to pay from a joint account but, for the life of him, could not remember the PIN.</p><p>“After searching through my iPhone bank app to figure out how to reset my PIN I had failed,” Crawley <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tyson.crawley/posts/pfbid02aPhBbZjH8JnRLjfbYnQJ26w9FeRhgfk62tghon6zzREzmtcHtnyWNPJe6MGyCf1Dl\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recalled in a Facebook post</a>. “My dog was barking wildly, I had to get to work, and I was starting to freak.”</p><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/single-mom-gives-stranger-money-christmas-the-rock/\" target=\"_self\">Single Mom Gives Stranger $7 for Christmas – Then, He Leads Her to the Parking Lot</a></p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Surprise: A Stranger Had Him Covered</strong></h2><p>As Crawley began panicking, a man who had purchased a coffee right before him and exited the store witnessed the ordeal. He came back inside.</p><p>“Do you need some money?” he asked.</p><p>Crawley said no, that he just couldn’t remember his code, and it was okay. The man said it was fine, and then walked around to the register. When Crawley realized what he was doing, he insisted it was okay; he had the money but just needed to figure out his PIN.</p><p>“It’s a free country, isn’t it?” the stranger asked. “I can help a brother out, can’t I?”</p><p>Crawley was stunned. The bill was $110, but eventually, he accepted the <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/kindness-quotes/\">kind</a> man’s help. He then passed him the receipt and asked him to write down his number so that he could contact him and pay him back immediately.</p><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/reddit-comment-stranger-leave-abusive-relationship/\" target=\"_self\">Stranger Gives Woman Advice About Her Toxic Relationship – Receives an Unexpected Email From Her 6 Years Later</a></p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Final Twist: A Follow-Up Request</strong></h2><p>The attendant, whom Crawley said was just as stunned as he was, passed the man a pen. The stranger wrote on it, folded it down, and handed it to Crawley. Crawley was so overwhelmed and grateful that he insisted they take a photo together. Then the man left. </p><p>“I turned around to the attendant and she said, ‘Well that doesn’t happen every day,’” Crawley recalled. “I turned around to leave, and he was gone, literally gone. I went outside and could not see him anywhere.”</p><p>It was then that Crawley opened the receipt to look at the number and he received another shock. Instead of a phone number, the man had written down his name along with three game-changing words.</p><p>“John. Pass it on.”</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"pass it on written a receipt\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f6725\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/pass-it-on-written-a-receipt.png?id=54995389&amp;width=980\" />\n<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tyson.crawley/posts/pfbid02aPhBbZjH8JnRLjfbYnQJ26w9FeRhgfk62tghon6zzREzmtcHtnyWNPJe6MGyCf1Dl\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tyson Crawley / Facebook</a></small></p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Paying It Forward</strong></h2><p>Crawley wrapped his Facebook post with an important reminder.</p><blockquote>“Please be beautiful people, and remember it's not about keeping up with the joneses, having the biggest house, most expensive car, the largest bank account, but work with each other, after all, what is money compared to the quality of human life?” he wrote.</blockquote><p>Money comes and goes, but who we are as people and how we interact with one another is the essence of our being. Helping each other out when times are tough, even when we don’t know the person, is what makes us human, and what can make this life so beautiful.</p><p>So the next time you’re in a position to pay it forward, why not? Go ahead and buy that coffee for the person behind you. Pay that parking meter that’s about to expire for a total stranger. Donate toys to a toy drive, leave a super generous tip, or give a secret gift.</p><p>At the end of the day, it’s how we show up for each other and help one another out that matters. Everything else is just extra. <3</p>",

It was not, however, a routine meal for the patrons who came in that day.</p><p>You see, the group had come into the eatery with the intention of spreading <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/kindness-quotes/\">generosity</a>. They were a bunch of church-going friends who wanted to lift someone up ahead of the holidays, and they had hatched a plan.</p><p>In what James Deal described in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2834989263229850&amp;set=pcb.2834998026562307&amp;type=3&amp;theater\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook post</a> as the “1<sup>st</sup> Annual 100 dollar breakfast,” each of the 12 diners left Ballard a $100 tip at the end of the meal.

After work, she went out for lunch and “blessed” her server with a large tip.

Brilliant. </p><p>Speaking of ATP, he also did a parody of Taylor Swift's \"You Belong With Me\" to explain what ATP does and why it's needed in the body.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">- YouTube</small>        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">                <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b866ub2dOaI\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com</a>        </small>        </p>            <p>What's most excellent about McLachlin's song parodies is that he's clearly been teaching for quite some time, since former students are referencing being in his class at least 15 years ago, and yet he's still coming up with new ways to help students learn the material. When a teacher is that invested in their work, their enthusiasm gets passed onto students. </p><p>The parodied hits just keep on coming. This \"What Makes You Albumin\" version of One Direction's \"What Makes You Beautiful\" explains what albumin is and how it works. It was published just few days before this article was written. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">- YouTube</small>        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">                <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWftagRaSOc\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com</a>        </small>        </p>            <p>We love to see a teacher doing the most and clearly enjoying it. Putting biochemistry concepts into lyrics that fit the music and still make sense cannot be easy, but McLachlin seems to be up to the task. Keep up the excellent work, sir. </p><p>You can follow McLachlin for more biochemistry lessons <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@DerekMcLachlin\" target=\"_blank\">on YouTube</a>. </p>",

And they're still culturally relevant. The 2023 film <em>Anyone But You</em> had Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell recreate the Jack and Rose \"leaning over the deck of the Titanic\" scene we'll never forget.</p><hr /><h3>Their First Kiss on the set of the Titanic</h3><br /><img alt=\"titanic movie cover\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"4966c\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/titanic-movie-cover.jpg?id=55368691&amp;width=1200&amp;height=800&amp;quality=90&amp;coordinates=0%2C206%2C0%2C386\" /><p>Meeting on the set of <em>Titanic</em> in 1997, DiCaprio and Winslet instantly clicked amidst the gruelling seven-month shoot. Their chemistry was palpable, but both actors have insisted that their bond was purely platonic. Winslet once shared that while her friends were swooning over DiCaprio, to her, he was just “silly old Leo.” This early connection started a friendship that would endure the test of time and Hollywood’s pressures.</p><h3>Oscar Buzz and Romance Buzz</h3><br /><img alt=\"Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio at the Golden Globe Awards\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"7f090\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/kate-winslet-and-leonardo-dicaprio-at-the-golden-globe-awards.jpg?id=52499936&amp;width=1200&amp;height=800&amp;quality=90&amp;coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C262\" /><p>Their friendship has only blossomed over the years, punctuated by countless public appearances that left fans buzzing. Take the 1998 Golden Globes, for instance—Leo and Kate’s camaraderie was on full display as they cheered each other on, despite the endless swirl of romantic rumors. This pattern of mutual support and affectionate displays has persisted, proving that true friendship not only survives but thrives under the bright lights of Hollywood’s spotlight.</p><h3>Reuniting On The Silver Screen</h3><br /><img alt=\"Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet smiling on a couch in Revolutionary Road\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d48e4\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/leonardo-dicaprio-and-kate-winslet-smiling-on-a-couch-in-revolutionary-road.jpg?id=51945688&amp;width=980\" /><p>In 2008, DiCaprio and Winslet reunited on screen for <em>Revolutionary Road</em>, a film about a disintegrating marriage. Despite the intense and somewhat uncomfortable scenes, especially with Winslet’s then-husband Sam Mendes directing, their chemistry was as electric as ever. Winslet later reflected on their effortless ability to fall back into sync, likening it to muscle memory. This reunion showcased their incredible acting skills and highlighted the depth of their enduring friendship.</p><h3>She Thanked Leo (Before Her Husband)!</h3><br /><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span><p>At the 2009 Golden Globe Awards, Cameron Diaz and Mark Wahlberg presented the award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Drama to Kate Winslet for her stunning performance in <em>Revolutionary Road</em>. Winslet, overwhelmed with emotion, took the stage and apologized to the other nominees before expressing her disbelief at winning a second award that night.<br /></p><p>In her heartfelt speech, she thanked the Hollywood Foreign Press, her longtime agents, writer Richard Yates, the film’s cast and crew, the producers, the hair and makeup department, her dialect coach, and, notably, her co-star Leonardo DiCaprio before her husband and the film's director, Sam Mendes. Among the nominees were heavyweights like Anne Hathaway, Angelina Jolie, Meryl Streep, and Kristin Scott Thomas.</p><p>Winslet made sure to acknowledge her longtime friend and <em>Revolutionary Road</em> co-star, saying, \"Leo, I'm so happy I can stand here and tell you how much I love you and how much I've loved you for 13 years. Your performance in this film is nothing short of spectacular.\"</p><h3>Leo Walked Kate Down The Aisle</h3><br /><img alt=\"Moet &amp; Chandon Inside Ballroom at the 64th Annual Golden Globe Awards\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a9a7e\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/moet-chandon-inside-ballroom-at-the-64th-annual-golden-globe-awards.jpg?id=52499919&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;quality=90&amp;coordinates=0%2C33%2C0%2C1771\" /><p>In 2012, during a secret ceremony in New York, it was rumored that Leonardo DiCaprio gave Kate Winslet away at her wedding to Ned Rocknroll (born Abel Smith). This touching gesture demonstrated the depth of their bond, with DiCaprio standing by his friend’s side during one of the most significant moments of her life. This act of friendship showcased the unwavering support and love they have for each other, further cementing their status as one of Hollywood’s most beloved duos.</p><h3>And The Oscar Goes To...</h3><br /><img alt=\"Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, 88th Annual Academy Awards - Backstage And Audience\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"21d77\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/leonardo-dicaprio-and-kate-winslet-88th-annual-academy-awards-backstage-and-audience.jpg?id=52468845&amp;width=980\" /><p>Who can forget the 2016 Oscars when DiCaprio, finally nominated for his role in <em>The Revenant</em>, surprised Winslet on the red carpet? The reunion sparked joy and nostalgia for fans, reminding everyone of their timeless bond that began with <em>Titanic</em>.</p><p>During DiCaprio’s acceptance speech, Winslet couldn’t hold back her tears. As he spoke about the importance of protecting our planet, the camera caught Winslet’s emotional reaction, proving just how much his success meant</p><h3>They Didn't See Each Other For 3 Years!</h3><br /><img alt=\"Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio's emotional reunion during the pandemic\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"10f45\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/kate-winslet-and-leonardo-dicaprio-s-emotional-reunion-during-the-pandemic.jpg?id=52500009&amp;width=980\" /><p>The COVID-19 pandemic posed a significant challenge to their friendship, as travel restrictions kept them apart. Winslet described their emotional reunion after nearly three years as tear-filled and overwhelming, emphasizing how much they missed each other. “I couldn’t stop crying,” Winslet confessed, illustrating the profound connection they share. This reunion underscored the strength of their bond, one that thrives even in challenging times.</p><p>Their friendship was once again in the spotlight during the release of <em>Titanic's</em> 4K Ultra HD edition, where Winslet reminisced about their early days on set. She described young DiCaprio as a magnetic presence, full of energy and freedom, qualities that made working with him a delightful experience. Winslet’s reflections remind us of the joyful and enduring nature of their bond.</p><h3>Nearly 30 Years of Friendship</h3><br /><img alt=\"The 66th Annual Golden Globe Awards - ET Red Carpet Arrivals\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f4001\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/the-66th-annual-golden-globe-awards-et-red-carpet-arrivals.jpg?id=52499993&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;quality=90&amp;coordinates=0%2C17%2C0%2C545\" /><p>Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet’s friendship is a testament to the enduring power of genuine human connection amidst the glitz and glamour of Hollywood. Their story, filled with shared memories, mutual respect, and unwavering support, continues to inspire fans worldwide. In an industry where relationships can often be fleeting, their bond stands out as a heartwarming example of true friendship.</p><p>From their early days on the <em>Titanic</em> set to walking each other down the aisle and supporting each other’s career milestones, DiCaprio and Winslet's friendship reminds us that childhood friends never get old. As Winslet once said, “We’re bonded for life,” a sentiment that perfectly captures the deep and abiding connection they share.</p>",

Whatever aspect of Halloween is your favorite, you better believe there’s someone going “all in” on it. </p><p>So without further ado: Here are the best examples we’ve found on the Internet this week of people going “all in”—Halloween style. </p><h3>These amazingly creative couple's costumes</h3><br /><blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@almayduh/video/7565297530120981773\" class=\"tiktok-embed\"> <section> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@almayduh?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@almayduh\">@almayduh</a> Beez in the chokey  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/couplescostume?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"couplescostume\">#couplescostume</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/halloween?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"halloween\">#halloween</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/matilda?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"matilda\">#matilda</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/trunchbull?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"trunchbull\">#trunchbull</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/youcandoitbruce?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"youcandoitbruce\">#youcandoitbruce</a> @Libby 💋 ⎕ <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7537176505709808415?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - dj auxlord\">♬ original sound - dj auxlord</a> </section> </blockquote> <p>The best part about Halloween (aside from the candy, of course) is arguably seeing everyone’s creativity on full display. And let’s face it, couples costumes are a perfect way someone can go “all in.” There’s so much imagination here, and so many examples on social media we could hardly pick just one. There’s <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@b.stott/video/7563411999091068215?lang=en\">Miss Lippy and Billy Madison</a>. There’s <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@lenzci___/video/7565332859658046750?lang=en\">Debbie and Fester</a>, from the Adam’s Family. But our favorite this year probably has to go to <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@almayduh/video/7565297530120981773\">Miss Trunchbull and Bruce Bogtrotter,</a> from the movie adaptation of Matilda. Not only do they bear a striking resemblance to the characters, but everything from the style of the costumes to the chocolate smeared on Bruce's face is on point. Well done. </p><h3>This girl's undying love for Michael Meyers</h3><br /><blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@breblc/video/7547904507301154062\" class=\"tiktok-embed\"> <section> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@breblc?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@breblc\">@breblc</a> safe to say p is not afraid of the Halloween decor <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"fyp\">#fyp</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryou?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"foryou\">#foryou</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7547904540163574541?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - breblc\">♬ original sound - breblc</a> </section> </blockquote> <p>Given that the <em>Halloween</em> movie franchise is creeping up on its 50th anniversary (yes, really—we checked, and now we feel old), it’s no surprise that plenty of adults are still obsessed with Michael Myers and his never-ending reign of terror. But toddlers? That’s a new one.</p><p>Still, this little girl can’t get enough. In the <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@breblc/video/7547904507301154062?embed_source=121374463%2C121468991%2C121439635%2C121749182%2C121433650%2C121404359%2C121497414%2C121477481%2C121351166%2C121811500%2C121896267%2C121860360%2C121487028%2C74846152%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%2C121885509%3Bnull%3Bembed_card_play&amp;refer=embed&amp;referer_url=www.upworthy.com%2Fr%2Fentryeditor%2F2674248169%23publish&amp;referer_video_id=7547904507301154062\">now-viral TikTok</a>, she takes her miniature Michael Myers doll everywhere and even naps with him, referring to him as “Michael” and her “baby.” It doesn’t get more adorable than this—even if, you know, her “big buddy” is wielding a knife. It’s clear that even though people our age might know Michael Meyers as a killer, he’s not a horror icon to everyone. To some, he’s just a bestie. </p><h3>Group costumes (and healthy snack bars) </h3><br /><blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@allinsnacks/video/7566027306980904205\" class=\"tiktok-embed\"> <section> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@allinsnacks?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@allinsnacks\">@allinsnacks</a> idk how the spooky font happened but honestly I’m all in for it  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"fyp\">#fyp</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/allin?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"allin\">#allin</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/halloween?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"halloween\">#halloween</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/costumes?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"costumes\">#costumes</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/shrek?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"shrek\">#shrek</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7566027386929171213?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - allinsnacks\">♬ original sound - allinsnacks</a> </section> </blockquote> <p>This company is so committed to going “all in,” they’ve literally baked that phrase into their name. This week, they're showing us that couples aren't the only ones going \"all in\" on costumes this year—there are also small groups dressing up together, and their dedication to the craft is impressive. <br /></p><p>Take this Shrek-themed group, for example. In the video, they reveal their group costume and they look exactly like the characters—particularly Lord Farquad. Seriously, <em>bravo</em>. </p><p>And speaking of our friends at All In—did we mention their snack bars are the perfect example of going \"all in,\" too? Packed with fiber, nuts, and seeds, these bars are the perfect snack who wants something delicious AND chock-full of healthy stuff. </p><p>If that sounds scrumptious (and how could it not?!), you'll be happy to know that you can actually try one <em>for free</em> if you order through Sprouts Farmers Market, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4nxsNts\">here</a>. Simply snap a picture of your receipt and you'll be reimbursed through the Aisle app. Easy peasy! </p><h3>These insane pumpkin carvings </h3><br /><blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@pumpkinbrains/video/7418340201728134443\" class=\"tiktok-embed\"> <section> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@pumpkinbrains?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@pumpkinbrains\">@pumpkinbrains</a> ✨ Are you Ready For It? 🎃My second pumpkin of 2024 is inspired by none other than Taylor Swift! 🌟 <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/pumpkincarving?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"pumpkincarving\">#PumpkinCarving</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/taylorswift?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"taylorswift\">#TaylorSwift</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/pumpkinart?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"pumpkinart\">#PumpkinArt</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/pumpkinbrains?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"pumpkinbrains\">#PumpkinBrains</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/swiftie?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"swiftie\">#Swiftie</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/halloween2024?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"halloween2024\">#Halloween2024</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/artreveal?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"artreveal\">#ArtReveal</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/beforeandafter?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"beforeandafter\">#BeforeAndAfter</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/masterpiece?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"masterpiece\">#Masterpiece</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/pumpkin?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"pumpkin\">#pumpkin</a> @Taylor Swift <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/Ready-For-It-6752003161755486209?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ ...Ready For It? - Taylor Swift\">♬ ...Ready For It? - Taylor Swift</a> </section> </blockquote> <p>Is it possible to go \"all in\" on something as grounding, as unfocused, as (dare we say it?) <em>meditative</em> as pumpkin carving? Apparently, it's possible. Just ask these folks. They're not satisfied with a simple Jack o' Lantern. Instead,<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@thatkerigirl/video/7565530635561995550?_r=1&amp;_t=ZT-90xuFvDe583\"> their pumpkins </a>are life-like replicas of movie monsters, pop stars, and even a lost-and-found box full of crocs. </p><p>But as creative and elaborate as those examples are, nothing will prepare you for this creator, known as @pumpkinbrains, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@pumpkinbrains/video/7563459446026849567\">who carves incredibly intricate portraits of famous people</a> in her pumpkins—and they're so realistic you almost wonder if you're looking at AI (you're not! We fact-checked this, too).

These creators wouldn't dream of something so simple. TikTok is full of examples of people going \"all in\" with their Halloween decorations—but we have to say that the best example we've found is <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@propyprops\">this person's </a>enormous replica of Titanic from Boise, Idaho. The scale of these decorations is beyond impressive, but the attention to detail is even more so. Look closely and you'll spot a few skeletons re-enacting scenes from the movie Titanic (yep, the Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio version)—sketch pad and all. </p><p class=\"\"><em>Snag your free (!!) snack bar <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4nxsNts\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> while this deal lasts.

They found that around age 50, the aging process accelerates, and blood vessels start aging earlier than other organs.</p><p>To learn more about the aging princess, the researchers collected tissue samples from 76 organ donors between the ages of 14 and 68 who had died of traumatic brain injury. The samples were taken from seven of the body’s systems: cardiovascular (heart and aorta), digestive (liver, pancreas, and intestine), immune (spleen and lymph node), endocrine (adrenal gland and white adipose), respiratory (lung), integumentary (skin), and musculoskeletal (muscle).</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"old watch, aging hands, senior women, wrinkled hands, time, passing of time,\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"002f8\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTQxNzI4Ni9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NDM5MzE0NX0.dRGlRxPG0hwwvGhH4Bi7JOcUu3dmI6Hz-0hYQs77P6E/img.png?width=980\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A senior woman's hands holding a watch. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">via <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Canva/Photos</a></small></p><h2>The body’s aging process speeds up between 45 and 55</h2><p>After studying the proteins found in different systems, the researchers found that the most stark changes in the aging process occurred between the ages of 45 and 55. The greatest amount of changes happened in the aorta, the body’s main artery that runs that passes over the heart from the left ventricle and runs down the front of the backbone.</p><p>The researchers hope that their work will eventually lead to mapping of the entire body, where we can better understand the process on an organ-by-organ basis. That could lead to one day having different biological ages for various body parts based on proteins and lifestyle choices. One could have a liver that's 35 and an aorta in its 50s. \"These insights may facilitate the development of targeted interventions for aging and age-related diseases, paving the way to improve the health of older adults,\" the authors concluded.</p><p>It may be a bit jarring for younger people to know that just like they may have enjoyed a growth spurt while in high school, they can also look forward to an aging spurt that happens at 50. The good news is that if you are past 55, then you are likely to be able to look forward to a phase where the aging process slows down a bit. </p>",

All at once, clues about humanity’s past, present, and future are revealed. </p><p>For instance, why do so many words with a negative connotation begin with the letter “n”? Sure, there are obvious exceptions, like nice, nifty, neat, etc., but when you think about not, never, nothing, nihilistic, nought, and yes, even the word negative itself…seems like a lot. Is this just an English language thing? Does the letter “n” have an inherently negative quality in our collective psyche? If so…why? </p><p>This was a topic recently tackled by etymology enthusiast <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dn0qwJlkqcg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>@humanteneleven</u></a>. In a short-and-sweet video, he explains that in the days of Old English, the word “ne,” meaning “not,” was used to negate, or give the opposite meaning, of virtually anything. N + one + “none,” n + either + \"neither,\" and so on. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">- YouTube</small>        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">                <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dn0qwJlkqcg\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com</a>        </small>        </p><p>Even with English words that were borrowed from Latin, as well as other non-English languages like French, German, Russian, and Sanskrit, we see this pattern. That’s because the Proto-Indo-European language, the mother of all these languages, also used the word “ne” to negate meaning. </p><p>However, just to complicate things a bit, we also see this in languages that did not originate from Proto-Indo-European, like Japanese and Vietnamese. This prompted a linguist by the name of Otto Jespersen in the late 1880s to theorize that there must be some primal association of negative feelings with the “n” sound. According to him, it was carried over from when ancient humans scrunch up their nose in contempt, and the sound would follow. “The biological reaction of disgust is inherently nasal,” explained @humanteneleven.</p><p>Over a hundred years later, <a href=\"https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/lingty-2020-2034/html?lang=en&amp;srsltid=AfmBOorhtW86XpKc2JTSrAsDRb4uXQbBIya_E-f5Z9XbtJ2Se73UL0RE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>researchers</u></a> tested the theory, and found that this correlation was more of a coincidence.

She was dealing with a large debt and struggling to pay it off by working two jobs. Then, something incredible happened to her – the debt vanished. Here's how it all went down.\n</p><h3>A Familiar Story: Graduating With Debt</h3><br /><img alt=\"jasmin ford and her son\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"12dcd\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/jasmin-ford-and-her-son.png?id=54969765&amp;width=980\" /><p><br /></p><h3></h3><br /><p>When Ford received her bachelor’s degree in 2011, she was the first person in her <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/family-quotes/\" target=\"_self\">family</a> to graduate from college. She was proud and didn’t stop there, returning to school to get her nursing degree.</p><p>It was tough, especially since Ford didn’t have any family assistance to help her to pay for things. In order to afford necessities like food and rent, plus her tuition, she relied on student loans, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Living/bank-surprises-single-mom-paying-off-150k-student/story?id=59797289\" target=\"_blank\">reports </a><em><a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Living/bank-surprises-single-mom-paying-off-150k-student/story?id=59797289\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ABC News</a>.</em></p><p>“I could not foresee when I’d be able to pay it off,” Ford told the publication. “I just knew this was going to be a part of my life as long as I was alive unless there was some significant change.”</p><h3>Arrival of Surprising News</h3><br /><p>At 30 years old, Ford was working nearly every day at two jobs and providing for her two-year-old son, Caleb. She didn’t see an end in sight, but then out of nowhere, Fifth Third Bank contacted her and told her it was paying off her $150,000 loans, free and clear.</p><blockquote><strong></strong>“I still can’t find the words [...] I’m off work again today, and I’m just sort of pacing around and restless because I know my life is going to change.” -Jasmin Ford</blockquote><p>The bank had selected Ford after she was chosen to participate in a documentary about student loan debt. She thought the crew was coming to her house to shoot some extra footage when they dropped the news.</p><p>“The documentary in itself was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” she continued. “I’m a South Side of Chicago nurse and I have a kid, that in itself is not that exciting, and I got to be in a documentary and I met some amazing people on the way.”</p><h3>A Life-Changing Moment</h3><br /><p>Ford was surprised by the amazing gesture, and knows it is a game changer for herself and her son.</p><p>“His life will be totally different,” she said. “I’m so happy and so proud that I’m able to offer that to him more than anything else because he deserves it.”</p><p>Looking forward, Ford is excited to pay it forward with her nursing degree, but also just to have more freedom, both <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/mental-health-quotes/\" target=\"_self\">mentally</a> and physically. She wants to spend less time hustling and more time with her family, all while embracing what comes next.</p><p>“I can open myself to more experiences, opportunities and just be able to sit and be with my thoughts and be able to pursue what it is I came to do,” she added.</p><h3>A Lesson in Perseverance</h3><br /><p>Ford’s story is a perfect example of the fact that while there’s something to be said for pursuing your <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/goals-quotes/\" target=\"_self\">dreams</a> and working hard, the road to success isn’t always easy. In fact, sometimes it feels completely riddled with obstacles that may make you want to give up.</p><p>But sometimes, good things really do happen to good people. Ford wasn’t expecting this level of help, but she knows just how game-changing it is.</p><p>Her story inspires many to hold onto hope and keep stepping forward even when the path is uphill because, in the end, it will somehow work out.</p><p>We just need to hold onto faith and, when times get tough, remember to keep pushing through.</p><h3></h3><br /><p><strong>More from Goalcast:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/man-buys-bank-that-refused-loan-18-years-ago/\" target=\"_self\">Man Buys The Bank That Refused Him A Loan When He Was Broke 18 Years Ago</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/nurse-lottery-mansion-omaze/\" target=\"_self\">Homeless Student Nurse Couch Surfs to Survive–but Christmas Came Early When She Wins $6M Home in Lottery</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/debt-community-facebook-mom-jeans/\" target=\"_self\">Struggling Single Mom With Staggering Debt Decides to Make a Change — And Bring Others With Her</a></li></ul><p></p><div class=\"rm-shortcode\">\n<div class=\"jwplayer-media\" id=\"botr_vhW9ib0F_rfvUMj7m_div\">\n<img class=\"jwplayer-media-preview\" src=\"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/vhW9ib0F-1920.jpg\" />\n</div>\n\n</div><br /><p></p><p>\n<br />\n</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><br />\n</h2>",

That’s particularly true for some teens, who work these jobs for part-time <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/how-to-save-money/\" target=\"_blank\">money</a> and are often <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/adult-bullying-is-real-heres-how-to-handle-it/\" target=\"_blank\">bullied</a> by adults. Perhaps that’s why people are applauding these teen girls for the way they expertly handled an over-the-top customer.</p><hr /><h3>An Angry Customer</h3><br /><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\">\n<div style=\"padding: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;\">\n<div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\">\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C883KFHuHkU/\" style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_top\">See on Instagram</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote><p>It was a tough day for employees at Keke’s Snow Balls in Texas when an angry woman approached the window. She had placed a pickup order for a snow cone and because of a shift change, the snow cone wasn’t ready. Two days later, the customer came back and demanded a refund of $6.</p><p>A girl named Victoria was working the counter and listened to the woman’s complaints. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CPIa1OpxEM\" target=\"_blank\">According to <em>Inside Edition</em></a>, it was immediately clear this woman didn’t want to resolve things in the right way, and was trying to pick a fight. Another employee named Kaeley overheard it all.</p><p>“I was just listening in the back and, eventually, I could just hear she’s angry the whole time. So I was like, clearly she just wants to have a problem,” Kaeley recalled to the publication. “And I’m not about that, so I was like, ‘Okay let me just go give her $6 and we can move on, move past this.’ It was $6.”</p><h3>An Unexpected Turn</h3><br /><p>At that point, the situation should have been resolved. However, Kaeley noticed the sign outside the window had fallen over during the dispute. So, she opened the window to fix it. That’s when the woman came by, slapped the sign out of the 17-year-old girl’s hand, and called her a derogatory name.</p><p>“M’am, please don’t act like that. You’re a grown woman,” Kaeley responded in a video that the restaurant then <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@kekessnowballs/video/7385726944513428767\" target=\"_blank\">posted to TikTok</a>. “You’re a grown woman. I’m 17. Get out of here. Don’t come back. Don’t come back. We don’t need your business.”</p><p>“I was scared and very confused,” Victoria added. “I wasn’t understanding what was going on.”</p><h3>A Brilliant Online Reaction</h3><br /><p>After the owner posted the video online, it went viral and many people reached out to support the girls for their perfect reaction to the customer.</p><p>“People were traveling to come and see us from hours away,” the owner, Kyle, told <em>Inside Edition</em>. “We had people reaching out to us on TikTok asking how to tip the girls. We even had people going and leaving Google reviews that haven’t even been to the shop, saying they’re so proud of the girls and how they dealt with it,” he continued. </p><p>Kyle explained that he posted the video to remind everyone that the employees behind the counter are people, too. Adults, in particular, should try to remember that oftentimes, these are kids working to save up for cars, school, and other big life steps.</p><p>“Mistakes happen, but for you to go up and act like that as an adult, my whole point in uploading that video is to simply remind us all that we need to treat people better,” Kyle added.</p><p>\"I am proud of the way our supervisor handled the situation,\" he added in <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C883KFHuHkU/\" target=\"_blank\">the initial post</a>. \"We must strive for better behavior and respect in all interactions. It’s all about just being a kind person and approaching every situation with willingness to come to a good resolution.\"</p><h3>We Are All the Same</h3><br /><p>As Kyle himself said, mistakes happen and no one is perfect. But demanding <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/why-youre-perfect-just-as-you-are/\" target=\"_blank\">perfection</a> of others can be a very lonely way to live. Rather than getting upset over an honest mistake and making someone feel bad or yelling at them, lead with grace and understanding. Not only will you help someone else feel respected, but you’ll probably get a better result from the situation, too.</p><p>When life doesn’t go our way, it can be easy to overreact or blame someone else. But by remembering that mistakes happen and this too shall pass, we can all live a little more peacefully.</p><p>Many of us are in these jobs because we’re trying to provide for our families or ourselves and our futures. Going to work can be hard enough, so remember to thank those who help you in the customer service industry and to tip well when appropriate. After all, we all want to feel appreciated at work. </p>",

And with the holidays on the horizon, one doctor is gently reminding folks the importance of partying responsibly—during the holidays and all year round.</p><p><a href=\"https://pages.doctorhoeflinger.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Brian Hoeflinger</a>, an Ohio based neurosurgeon with over two decades of experience, has a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@doctorhoeflinger\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TikTok channel</a> filled with educational videos and lifestyle tips. In late 2022, smack-dab in the middle of the holiday season, Dr. Hoeflinger shared a clip explaining just how long it takes our bodies to break down alcohol, and it went viral. In the video, which was shared on Christmas Eve of that year, Dr. Hoeflinger sets the scene of a party where “a lot of drinks are going down” by setting up a bunch of shot glasses filled with water.</p><p>“Say you’re having five drinks in the first hour,” he says, taking five water-filled shots. “As you’re taking them, that alcohol is building up in your system fast. [It] goes to your brain within five minutes and starts to affect you.\"</p><p>The same can’t be said for other parts of the body. As Dr. Hoeflinger noted, “Your liver only metabolizes one ounce of alcohol per hour.” And according to <a href=\"https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/alcohol-and-the-brain#:~:text=It%20is%20absorbed%20through%20the,your%20liver%20starts%20processing%20alcohol.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Northwestern Medicine</a>, that process only begins 20 minutes after consumption.</p><p>Hoeflinger continues, “I've got five ounces of liquor in my system right now, and at the end of the hour I'm only going to burn off an ounce…so I'm going to have [four] ounces left in my bloodstream.”</p><blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@doctorhoeflinger/video/7180782044249623854\" class=\"tiktok-embed\">\n        <section>\n            <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@doctorhoeflinger\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@doctorhoeflinger\">@doctorhoeflinger</a>\n            <p>Knowing this about drinking could save your life! #fyp #party #drinking #alcohol #foryou #holiday #christmas</p>\n        </section>\n    </blockquote>\n                            <p>Of course, there are different factors—such as body mass, hormones, medications, etc.—that affect someone’s <a href=\"https://consensus.app/questions/alcohol-absorption-rate/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">rate of absorption</a>. And yes, we might be able to form a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/alcohol-tolerance\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">functional tolerance</a> where behaviorally, we show no signs of intoxication. However, even with all these variables, for the most part all bodies are <a href=\"https://caps.ucsc.edu/counseling/aod/alcohol-facts-tips.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">affected by alcohol similarly</a>. In other words, your blood alcohol level will be more or less the same, and the risks will remain even if you don't \"feel drunk.\"</p><p>Hoeflinger continues, saying, “The party’s rockin’, so we’re gonna have some more,” while taking three more shots and reminding viewers that he still has only burned off one ounce of liquor during the hour that’s passed.</p><p>Now he’s had a total of eight ounces of alcohol in two hours. He’s burned off two, but still has six ounces left in his system—meaning that in this scenario, it will take another six hours to completely burn off.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"shots, alcohol, holiday, party, halloween, christmas, new years eve\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f4802\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjAwMTg2Ny9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NjIxNDk2M30.Sh7J8KZuQ624IMl4b2f0hK9bXG2IhxIkWUcWG0JSI68/img.png?width=933&amp;height=630&amp;quality=50&amp;coordinates=135%2C0%2C132%2C0\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Shots</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos/\" target=\"_blank\">via Canva Photos.</a></small></p><p>In hour three, Hoefligner takes one shot since the party is “winding down.” This brings him up to a total of nine ounces of alcohol over three hours. His liver has metabolized three ounces, leaving him (still) with six ounces of liquor left in his bloodstream.</p><p>“You’re going to be drunk well into the wee hours of the morning; it doesn’t wear off,” he warns, noting the common misconception people have that “they stop drinking an hour or two and can hop in the car and drive.\" But in reality, \"You can't do that as you're still drunk five, six hours down,” he explains.</p><p>Dr. Hoeflinger concludes his video by saying:</p><p>\"For this holiday season the whole point is I really want to tell people that's how alcohol can stack up in your system easily when you're drunk and you won't know it and it won't wear off for hours and hours down the road.\" This is followed by an urge for people to take an Uber or Lyft home to avoid potentially taking their own or another’s life.</p><p>The informative clip, which has since been viewed over 19 million times, received a flood of praise from viewers online, especially from parents with kids of a drinking age.</p><p>“This is the first time I have ever had anyone explain this in this way. I am forwarding this to my son,” wrote one parent.</p><p>It also resonated among designated drivers. One person commented, “thank you for caring and educating. I’m the sober ride. I've seen the devastation from drinking and driving.”</p><p>The topic hits Dr. Hoeflinger on a personal level as well. In a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@doctorhoeflinger/video/7180439326407265582?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">previous video</a>, he shared that he lost his 18-year old son nearly a decade ago from drunk driving. Coming from a medical professional, the plea to not drink and drive is important to hear. But as a parent, it hits different. As he shared in the clip, “Losing somebody you love is one of the worst experiences you can have in your life.”</p><blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@doctorhoeflinger/video/7180439326407265582\" class=\"tiktok-embed\">\n        <section>\n            <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@doctorhoeflinger\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@doctorhoeflinger\">@doctorhoeflinger</a>\n            <p>Have a plan this holiday season.  Don’t Drink and Drive #for you #fyp #drinking #uber #lyft #drunk #holidayseason #responsible #fun</p>\n        </section>\n    </blockquote>\n        <p>Though Hoeflinger focused on the effect of liquor in his party example, the principle applies to wine and beer as well. <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/how-long-does-it-take-for-alcohol-to-kick-in#tips\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Healthline</em></a> recommends only having one large glass of wine every three hours, and one pint of beer every two hours.</p><p>It also gives some best practices to avoid intoxication, including:</p><ul><li>Eat at least one hour before drinking.</li><li>Sip your drinks slowly.</li><li>Avoid shots, which you’re likely to down rather than sip.</li><li>Don’t drink more than one standard drink per hour.</li><li>Alternate between alcohol and nonalcoholic drinks, preferably water.</li><li>Limit or avoid carbonated drinks, like champagne, sparkling wine, and cocktails mixed with soda.</li><li>Sit down when drinking, since doing it while standing tends to make people drink faster.</li></ul><p>And of course, don’t be afraid to get another ride home. For the holiday season (and beyond), feel free to kick back and have fun. But let’s look out for one another by doing it safely.</p><p><em>This article originally appeared three years ago.

Countries with robust vacation cultures, like Denmark (which grants workers 25 days of PTO), the United Kingdom (28 days), and France (25 days) report higher job satisfaction, better mental health, and improved organizational loyalty.</p><p>So, in Iceland, taking your vacation isn’t seen as slacking off—it’s seen as essential maintenance for both your mental health and your ability to contribute meaningfully when you return.</p><p>It’s a virtuous cycle that benefits everyone: rested people are more effective at work. Simple as that.</p><p>“As an entrepreneur, I know how hard it is to step away,” said Siggi Hilmarsson, the company’s founder, in a press release. “But stepping away is where the real breakthroughs happen.”</p><p>And it’s more than talk. Beyond the PT-YO challenge, siggi’s and its parent company <a href=\"https://lactalisyogurtusa.com/careers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lactalis Group</a> support and offer a competitive suite of benefits for employees. Upon hire, siggi’s workers are granted automatic PTO days, and can build towards life insurance and a generous 401K plan.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://siggis.com/live-simply\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">mantra</a> here? “Life is stressful—but you’ll be surprised by how much simpler it gets when you slow down.”</p><p><br /></p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/iceland-RMTYzWW6FPWFoyuUmR\">via GIPHY</a></p></div><p><br /></p><h2><strong>America’s PTO problem: Why aren’t we taking time off?</strong></h2><p>Now, for the not-so-fun part. The contrast with American work culture is stark. Unlike Iceland and most European nations, the United States <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/workhours/vacation_leave\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">lacks any federal law</a> mandating paid vacation, personal time, or paid time off for private-sector workers. The average American private-sector worker receives about <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-state-of-paid-time-off-in-the-u-s-in-2024\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">12 days of PTO per year</a>, less than half of what Icelandic workers get as a legal minimum. But remember, this only goes for those with full benefits, and many workers (especially low-wage, part-time, or gig employees) get <a href=\"https://www.footholdamerica.com/blog/paid-time-off-in-the-usa-a-crucial-benefit-or-costly-perk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">far less or even none</a>.</p><p>But here’s the kicker: even those measly 12 days often go unused. A <a href=\"https://www.lanereport.com/175306/2024/07/one-third-of-u-s-employees-pto-vacation-days-go-unused\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2024 study found</a> that nearly two-thirds (62%) of Americans do not use all of their PTO, with 5.5% of American workers not using <em>any</em> of their PTO at all. The <a href=\"https://www.getsorbet.net/sorbet_pto_report_2024.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">same study</a> revealed that on average, employees only use 67% of their PTO allocation, leaving 33% behind! How many days is that, collectively? Well, siggi’s <a href=\"https://siggis.com/ptyo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">did the math</a>.</p><p>Americans left 700 million PTO days unused in 2024. That translates to $312 billion in untouched vacation days, just sitting there, relaxing, like you were supposed to be in Saint-Tropez last year. That’s not a typo, by the way. Billion.

Most of us have things we'd prefer our fellow passengers do or not do to make the experience better for everyone, however, so <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1281927547301567&amp;id=100064530016648&amp;mibextid=wwXIfr&amp;rdid=VREg45wZSqLfHoZB\" target=\"_blank\">we asked our <em>Upworthy</em> Facebook audience</a>, \"If you could enforce one social rule during flights, what would it be?\" The responses were largely what you might expect and you can see them below, but there was one unexpected comment that stood out. The rule that received the most love, with over 1,200 likes, was this one: </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"dog, flying, airplane, good dog, golden retriever\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"617a0\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk3NjQ2My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NzY0ODQ1Nn0.y0B1z1rARbk1GCb06LtNFBqa250MLDnGPuCRJqJwe_U/img.jpg?width=980\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Can we please get a \"meet the dog\" rule on airplanes?</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos\" target=\"_blank\">Photo credit: Canva</a></small></p><h2>Any dog on the plane has to visit every passenger that requests </h2><p>While not everyone loves dogs, <a href=\"https://www.dvm360.com/view/dogs-rule-cats-drool-americans-prefer-pups\" target=\"_blank\">most people do</a>. And what would make a flight more enjoyable than getting to meet a dog on board? Perhaps we can start a petition to make cabin doggy visits for anyone who wants them an official thing…</p><p>Other responses were helpful reminders of both common courtesy and somewhat standard airplane etiquette for those who might not fly often enough to be familiar with it. In addition to the \"meet the dog\" rule, here are 10 more social rules people wish they could enforce on flights:</p><h4>Be nice to flight attendants</h4><p>Imagine being responsible for both the comfort and safety of 100+ people from different places with different needs in a cabin hurtling through the sky 30,000 feet above the Earth. Flight attendants deal with a wide array of people day in and day out, and we should all make sure we treat them with the kindness and respect that they deserve. </p><h4>Middle seat gets the armrests</h4><p>Nobody should be hogging the armrests, but if anyone has a right to them, it's the sacrificial soul who has to sit in the middle seat. (And window seat controls the window, in case that's not common sense.)</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"headphones, flight, courtesy, airplane etiquette, flying\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"012bd\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk3NjQ4My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgyMjAxOTE5Mn0.qoG3wc4EmWTH6EpUuxgzdiDzXYv99M3sbtOybEIyQpc/img.jpg?width=980\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">No matter your age, headphones to listen to things on a flight are a must.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos\" target=\"_blank\">Photo credit: Canva</a></small></p><h4>Headphones, please</h4><p>No one wants to listen to your video but you. Imagine if everyone listened to movies or YouTube videos or whatever without headphones—total social chaos. In public and on planes, use headphones to listen or watch something. </p><h4>No 'manspreading'</h4><p>We all know the legroom on flights has become practically non-existent, and for people with long legs it can be hard to not bang your knees up against the seat in front of you. But spreading your legs apart so wide that it infringes on other people's leg space just isn't cool. We're all in the same boat, so we have to respect one another's space. </p><h4>Keep your shoes and socks on</h4><p>There may be an exception here for long-haul flights as long as you keep your socks on and don't have stinky feet, but bringing a pair of slippers or something is still courteous. But definitely keep your socks on and be aware that you might not be able to tell if your own feet smell. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"flying, flights, airplane, overhead bin, flight etiquette\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c84ee\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk3NjQ2Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgxNzI1NzQzMn0.nTn3Czb7_SbY_y6zHf4yFP6BlMa7DgwMTZXh_MAZCaQ/img.jpg?width=980\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">One overhead bag per passenger until everyone's got their luggage settled. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos\" target=\"_blank\">Photo credit: Canva</a></small></p><h4>Don’t put a second bag or a jacket in the overhead bin until everyone has put their first bag in</h4><p>Overhead space is limited, so wait until everyone has had a chance to get their carry-on into that space before adding more than your one bag to it. Once everyone's settled in, feel free to add whatever overflow you have.</p><h4>Try not to fart</h4><p>We've all been on a flight where someone let one rip and made everyone's eyes water. Unless you have zero choice in the matter, refrain from dropping gas bombs on your fellow passengers. We're all human and humans fart, but an airplane cabin is a tight spot where people can't get away. At least take it to the lavatory if you can. </p><h4>Be aware of smells in general</h4><p>Come clean and fresh, but not perfumed. Deodorant? Yes, please. Strong cologne or perfume? No. Food that emits a strong odor? Also no. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"flight attendant, safety presentation, airplane safety, seatbelts, courtesy\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"30dc0\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk3NjQ2OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3OTIwNDgwNn0.xBtuHuZWf1wCwitAEzDVcYlFP8MM5Hd8zwv-TYasUTo/img.jpg?width=980\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Even if you know it by heart, please don't talk during the safety demonstration.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos\" target=\"_blank\">Photo credit: Canva</a></small></p><h4>Stay quiet during the safety demonstration</h4><p>Some people fly all the time and could recite the safety demonstration spiel by heart, but that doesn't mean everyone is familiar with it. It only takes a few minutes and first-time flyers need to hear it. It's respectful to the flight attendants to not talk through their presentation and courteous to other passengers who need to listen. </p><h4>Remain seated until it’s your row’s turn to deplane</h4><p>On most flights, as soon as the plane arrives at the gate and the seatbelt sign is turned off, people rush to stand up and gather their luggage. But it's always going to take several minutes to even start getting the first passengers off the plane, and it's not going to go any faster to crowd into the aisle.  </p><p>If we all follow these \"rules,\" flying can be a more pleasant experience for everyone—even our good doggo friends who might be on board. </p>",

Once the royal hunting grounds of the maharajas of Mysore, the place today offers a union of primal wilderness and serene beauty. For <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/417288/treehouse-stays-india-eco-luxury-travel-2025/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">couples looking for solitude</a>, immersion in nature, and moments of bonding, this riverside sanctuary is an ideal retreat.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Set on the banks of the Kabini River and bordering the Nagarhole Tiger Reserve, this corridor of forest and water is a timeless haven for wildlife and travellers alike. With careful planning, it is possible to experience Kabini&rsquo;s grandeur without extravagance, making it the perfect destination for couples seeking meaningful connection amid the rhythms of the natural world.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Day 1: Onward to Kabini</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Begin your journey at first light, departing Bengaluru before dawn to make the most of the day. The road to Kabini stretches just over 200 kilometres and typically takes five to six hours by car. A self-drive option offers freedom and privacy, although hiring a cab is equally practical, with round-trip expenses ranging from Rs 2,500 to Rs 4,500.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Stop en route in Mysuru for a leisurely breakfast, perhaps crisp dosas and a cup of filter coffee at one of its eateries, before continuing south through a changing landscape of fields, forests and riverside villages.</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Budget trip to Kabini\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/27/budget-trip-to-kabini-2025-10-27-19-28-19.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Set on the banks of the Kabini River and bordering the Nagarhole Tiger Reserve, this corridor of forest and water is a haven for wildlife. Photograph: <a href=\"https://www.toehold.in/blog/spectacular-wildlife-of-kabini\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(Toehold)</a></em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Upon arrival in Kabini, check into one of the region&rsquo;s modest yet atmospheric accommodations. Lodges such as Kabini Lake View Resort, Red Earth&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/334115/best-homestays-in-himachal-pradesh-uttarakhand-to-enjoy-snowfall-in-winter/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">eco cottages</a>, or the more affordable dormitories of Kabini River Lodge provide restful stays beginning from Rs 2,000 per night, often inclusive of home-cooked meals.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the afternoon wanes, enjoy a boat safari along the Kabini River. For Rs 800 to Rs 1,200 per person, one glides through placid waters framed by ancient trees, watching elephants bathe on the shore, crocodiles sun themselves on muddy banks, and kingfishers dart through the reeds. It is a gentle and unforgettable encounter with the wild.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Return at dusk to your lodge, where dinner is typically a hearty local spread of rice, lentils, vegetables, and perhaps a mild meat curry, enjoyed in the open air or a rustic dining hall. The evening is best spent beneath a canopy of stars, far from the din of the city, accompanied only by the <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/environment/uttarakhand-van-panchayat-history-collective-of-women-managing-forests-10557653\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sounds of the forest</a>.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Day 2: Into the forest&rsquo;s heart</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The day begins early with a guided safari into Nagarhole National Park, a highlight of any visit to Kabini. Organised by the Karnataka Forest Department, these safaris, priced at Rs 500 to Rs 600 per person for Indian nationals, offer a chance to observe wildlife in its natural habitat.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The forest, a mosaic of deciduous trees, open meadows and winding riverbanks, is home to tigers, leopards, wild dogs, deer, gaur, and an astonishing variety of birds. While sightings are never guaranteed, the anticipation itself is thrilling. Even a quiet morning among trees stirred only by the rustle of leaves is a rare privilege.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Budget trip to Kabini\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/27/budget-trip-to-kabini-2025-10-27-19-33-05.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Upon arrival in Kabini, check into one of the region's modest yet atmospheric accommodations Photograph: </em><a href=\"https://www.thrillophilia.com/kabini-resorts\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>(Thrillophilia)</em></a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After the safari, return to your accommodation for a late breakfast and a morning at leisure. Couples may choose to relax in the shade of their cottage verandah, read, or simply enjoy the peaceful atmosphere. Later in the day,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/travel/eco-tourism-tourism/kids-nature-walks-india-family-travel-outdoors-learning-wildlife-eco-tourism-10534761\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">join a nature walk</a> (typically Rs 200 to Rs 400 per person) led by a local naturalist. These walks explore the quieter aspects of the forest, including native flora, animal tracks, and bird calls, and encourage a slower, more observant way of travelling.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As twilight approaches, you may opt for a second boat ride or rest by the riverbank, watching the sky soften and the forest settle into silence.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Day 3: Farewell to the wilderness</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Spend your final morning on a short village visit or plantation walk, should your lodge offer such excursions (generally Rs 150 to Rs 300 per person). These are immersive experiences that offer a glimpse into the symbiotic relationship between the local communities and the land they inhabit.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Depart Kabini by mid-morning to allow for an unhurried return to Bengaluru. En route, consider stopping in Mysuru for lunch; many reputable establishments serve traditional Karnataka meals for under Rs 400 per couple.</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Budget trip to Kabini\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/27/budget-trip-to-kabini-2025-10-27-19-36-50.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>As the afternoon wanes, enjoy a boat safari along the Kabini River Photograph: </em><a href=\"https://www.vacationindia.com/travelguide/boat-trip-down-the-kabini-river/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>(Vacation India)</em></a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the city skyline reappears, Kabini remains with you as a memory of stillness, of whispered conversations, and of a shared moment in time when the world slowed down.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Estimated budget for two (three days / two nights)</h2>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Travel (self-drive or cab): Rs 2,500 - Rs 4,500</li>\n<li>Accommodation: Rs 4,000 - Rs 8,000</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/452459/wildlife-watching-with-kids-india-guide/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Safari and activities</a>: Rs 2,000 - Rs 3,000</li>\n<li>Meals and additional costs: Rs 1,500 - Rs 2,000</li>\n<li>Total estimated cost for two: Rs 10,000 to Rs 17,000</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kabini is not a place to rush through, but to dwell in.

You wake up every morning and have an all-you-can-eat breakfast. Spend the afternoon hanging out by the pool or touring a fantastic city such as Rome or Dubrovnik. At night, have a drink in the lounge <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/comedians-english-lessons-highlight-the-absurdity-of-english-spelling-and-pronunciation\" target=\"_blank\">watching a comedian</a> or a jazz band, then hit the sack and do it all over again the next day. Seems too good to be true for the average person, right? Think again.</p><p>Austin Wells of San Diego<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/07/can-you-live-on-a-cruise-ship-yes-and-heres-how-much-it-costs.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> told CNBC</a> that he could make it happen at just 28 years old because it’s <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/real-estate-broker-breaks-down-why-middle-class-millennials-and-gen-z-cant-afford-housing\" target=\"_blank\">cheaper than living onshore </a>in Southern California and he gets to see the world. “The thing that most excites me is I don’t have to upend my daily routine, in order to go see the world,” Wells told CNBC.</p><p>“I’m going from this model where you want to go somewhere, you pack a bag, you get on a flight, you rent a room, to now my condo, my gym, my doctors and dentists, all of my grocery stores travel the world with me,” he added.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">- YouTube</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5tvjHHAxHo\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com</a></small></p><p><br /></p><p>Wells purchased an apartment on the Storylines <a href=\"https://www.storylines.com/the-ship\" target=\"_blank\">MV Narrative</a>, which is being built in Croatia. When he'll actually get to live on it is still a big question, as the build has faced delays and financial hiccups. The ship's sailing date has been pushed out from 2025 to <a href=\"https://www.cruiseind.com/will-storylines-residential-ship-mv-narrative-ever-set-sail/\" target=\"_blank\">a tentative launch in 2027.</a></p><p>The rough math for Wells' dream makes perfect sense on paper, though. He purchased a 12-year lease on the ship for $300,000. That comes to about $2,100 a month if he didn’t have to take out a loan. By comparison, most apartments in San Diego cost <a href=\"https://www.rentcafe.com/average-rent-market-trends/us/ca/san-diego/\" target=\"_blank\">more than $2,100 per month</a> in rent.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"cruise ship, pool on a cruise ship, cruise ship living, cheaper than rent\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e970b\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81ODI1NzM3Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NjgxNDkwM30.olVNvVeVZ3WyQbs4MTvCUMfms5mREMZGBO2rmlePULk/img.jpg?width=980\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Some people call cruise ships home.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqFfX0A8UAc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Photo credit: Canva</a></small></p><p>The ship charges an additional $2,100 a month for all-inclusive services, which include food, drinks, alcohol, gym membership, routine healthcare check-ups, onboard entertainment and laundry.</p><p>So, it could cost Wells as little as $4,200 a month to live an all-expenses-paid life.

Yet for millions of people, purpose feels elusive, like some far-off destination, an epiphany waiting for divine intervention.</p><p>Narratives around living the life of your dreams can package purpose in a very set way, telling stories of a select few who were lucky enough to find their purpose, and never looked back.</p><p>All of these assumptions about purpose make it both intimidating and seemingly unattainable. Factor in cultural ideas of what purpose looks like — from starting a billion-dollar venture in Silicon Valley to living a life in service of the greater good — and you’ll likely be left feeling frustrated, or confused, about how to add purpose to your life.</p><p>Fortunately, these assumptions are misleading. Purpose is much easier to attain than it seems on the surface. And, thankfully, the Japanese concept of ikigai makes discovering your purpose practical. There’s no need to wait for a eureka moment, or yearn for the day purpose will arrive on your doorstep. With ikigai as your own personal Japanese secret, you can start taking deliberate steps to add purpose to your days and inhabit a more happy life. This article will show you how you can start your own personal ikigai journey. Let’s get started!</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-japanese-concept-of-ikigai\">What is the Japanese concept of Ikigai?</h2><p>The best translation for ikigai (pronounced “ee key guy”) is “a reason for being.” The term is formed from the Japanese words iki (life) and gai (worth or benefit).</p><p>Ikigai is central to Japanese culture, with its origin stretching all the way back to the Heian period, a period of classical Japanese history lasting between the years 794 and 1185.</p><p>American researcher Dan Buettner, who presented the popular Ted Talk How to Live to 100, identified ikigai as one of the main factors for greater longevity in Japan. Buettner popularized the concept in the West in the early 2000s.</p><p>Long before then, Japanese psychiatrist Mieko Kamiya, the Mother of Ikigai, wrote one of the most popular modern-day books on the philosophy, Ikigai-ni-Tsuite (What Makes Our Life Worth Living), in 1966. This was around the time early positive psychology was born. Psychologists such as Abraham Maslow, Carl Rogers, and Viktor Frankl shifted the paradigm of psychology away from pathology, and towards what makes for a fulfilling, meaningful life.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Maslow\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"11c35\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/maslow.jpg?id=51945982&amp;width=980\" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"moving-towards-a-more-meaningful-life\">Moving towards a more meaningful life</h3><p>Kamiya herself compared ikigai to Frankl’s approach to meaning. Both were well-versed in how suffering could lead to personal growth. Frankl from his time spent in concentration camps during the Holocaust, and Kamiya worked with leprosy patients. Kamiya described ikigai as:</p><p>“Ikigai means ‘power necessary for one to live in this world, happiness to be alive, benefit, effectiveness.’ When we try to translate it into English, German, French etc, it seems that there is no other way to define it other than ‘worth living’ or ‘value or meaning to live’. Thus, compared to philosophical theoretical concepts, the word ikigai shows us how ambiguous the Japanese language is, but because of this it has an effect of reverberation and amplitude.”</p><p>She acknowledged that “the fact that this word exists should indicate that the goal to live, its meaning and value within the daily life of the Japanese soul has been problematized.” In other words, the word exists because modern-living, to some degree, has disconnected people from their innate sense of purpose, or their soul’s calling.</p><p>Kamiya further defines ikigai into two categories — the source of ikigai, and the state of mind someone feels when connected to the source (ikigai-kan). For Kamiya, ikigai-kan is linked to Frankl’s concept of meaning. In life, a person’s mission is to connect to their mission. Failure to do so can result in depression or anxiety.</p><p>In order to become clear on this mission, Kamiya suggested two questions:</p><ol><li>What is my existence for?</li><li>What is the purpose of my existence?</li></ol><h3 id=\"gaining-clarity\">Gaining Clarity</h3><p>Once clarity is gained, ikigai becomes the North Star that you are guided to. The journey itself is what’s important, not the final destination. Those who are moving towards that North Star experience a sense of fulfillment, ikigai-kan.</p><p>Kamiya was careful to note those pursuing their purpose weren’t always distinguished people — someone can be in service to ikigai when raising children, teaching at schools, or working in medicine. What’s most important is that a person is able to connect to their purpose, and honor it, in whichever way is unique to them.</p><p>For Kamiya, the process of clarifying and honoring their soul’s calling is the discovery of a new theme of existence. For many people, this process could unfold during a spiritual awakening, where their motivations radically transform. For others, it could be a slight, but noticeable change of direction.</p><h2 id=\"ikigai-and-maslow-s-hierarchy-of-needs\">Ikigai and Maslow’s hierarchy of needs</h2><p>In addition to parallels between Frankl’s work on the value of meaning, Kamiya also discovered that to experience ikigai-kan, someone must first have several personal needs met. The result is a similar model of thinking to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, which outlines the journey of growth and self-actualization.</p><p>The needs Kamiya identified are:</p><p>The need for life satisfaction<br />The need for change and growth<br />The need for a bright future<br />The need for resonance<br />The need for freedom<br />The need for self-actualization<br />The need for meaning and value</p><p>These closely resemble Maslow’s pyramid of physiological needs, safety needs, love and belonging, esteem, self-actualization, and self-transcendence (the often forgotten additional layer). It’s worth keeping in mind, though, that Maslow noted for some, lower levels can be transcended by higher values, such as creativity being more important than safety needs or esteem.</p><p>The same can be said of ikigai — if your mission or purpose is something greater than you, it’s likely that it can overshadow other personal needs and contribute to well being.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-ikigai-important-for-a-fulfilling-life\">Why is Ikigai important for a fulfilling life?</h2><p>As Buettner discovered, meaning is one of the most influential factors in living a long and healthy life, both for younger generations and those that are older. Buettner has researched so-called Blue Zones, the locations where people lived for longer and enjoyed greater wellbeing.</p><p>Five locations Buettner discovered were Okinawa, Japan; Sardinia, Italy; Nicoya, Costa Rica; Ikaria, Greece, and Loma Linda, California. He noticed that these five locations placed a lot of emphasis on meaning and purpose.</p><p>This has been backed up by multiple studies. A 2014 UCL-led study of 9,000 people with an average age of 65 found that those with a greater sense of meaning and purpose were 30 percent less likely to die in the following eight-year period. More recently in 2019, a study of 7,000 people over the age of 50 found “life purpose was significantly associated with all-cause mortality.” So much so, the lowest scorers of the study were twice as likely to have died than those with the highest scores five years later.</p><h3 id=\"the-power-of-ikigai\">The power of ikigai</h3><p>Noriyuki Nakashi, from Osaka University, explains the power of ikigai as:</p><p>“Ikigai is personal: it reflects the inner self of an individual and expresses that faithfully.<br />Ikigai, which is the highest level of desire, may be considered to be essentially the process of cultivating one’s inner potential and that which makes one's life significant, a universal human experience we all wish to achieve.”</p><p>Purpose gives you a deeper reason for living, it makes your life significant. As noted by thinkers such as Kamiya and Frankl, there is an interesting component to this — it appears, deep down, each of us has a purpose that we intuitively know and understand. Our mission is to listen to that calling and do all we can to honor it, in order to cultivate our inner potential.</p><p>Longevity is a byproduct of doing something right. Purpose gives you the energy and inspiration to pursue your goals, overcome struggle, and keep going when times are tough. It provides strong foundations of fulfillment and can give your life a new direction, not towards fleeting happiness, but towards things of high value. In the words of Oscar Wilde: “To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.”</p><h2 id=\"understanding-the-ikigai-chart-and-your-own-ikigai-journey\">Understanding the Ikigai chart and your own ikigai journey</h2><p>Are you ready for your mind to be blown by ikigai, the Japanese secret that so many swear by? For your understanding of ikigai to take a drastic u-turn into a new theme of existence? The ikigai venn diagram, shared by millions and rising to meme-like popularity on social media, isn’t linked to ikigai. Instead, it was an idea from Marc Winn, an entrepreneur and blogger who merged the idea of ikigai with a venn diagram of purpose.</p><p>Winn was introduced to the concept of ikigai and the ikigai diagram from Buettner’s Ted Talk. “I don’t know whether to laugh or cry,” he wrote in 2017, “less than an hour of my time has made more of a difference in the world than all my time put together.”</p><p>Winn acknowledges his own surprise that his idea, and the diagram, spiraled out of control. The diagram is shown below:</p><img alt=\"Ikigai: The True Meaning with Diagrams, Definitions, &amp; Myths | Sloww\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"52525\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/ikigai-the-true-meaning-with-diagrams-definitions-myths-sloww.jpg?id=51945986&amp;width=980\" /><p>While the venn diagram is incredibly useful, there’s one major downside — the true meaning of ikigai isn’t about making money. The diagram might be valuable in understanding how you can launch a career of meaning, but in many ways, it’s the result of ikigai running through the money-oriented worldview of the West.<br />In fact, a 2010 study of 2,000 people in Japan found that only a third saw work as their ikigai. In addition, the Japanese translation of life means both your lifespan, and everyday life. This leads to another possible misinterpretation — ikigai can be discovered in the simple, day-to-day joys of living, not a grandiose plan or life mission worthy of Hollywood fame. It’s a spectrum of joy, from the seemingly mundane to the miraculous, and everything between.</p><h2 id=\"the-five-pillars-of-ikigai\">The five pillars of ikigai</h2><p>So if the ikigai isn’t discovered through a venn diagram, how do you apply the concept to your life? In The Little Book of Ikigai, Japanese neuroscientist and author Ken Mogi offers a five-pillar framework. By following this framework, you’re able to cultivate the type of lifestyle that allows for the emergence of ikigai:</p><h3 id=\"pillar-one-start-small\">Pillar One: Start Small</h3><p>Discovering a new theme of existence begins with small steps. That could be as simple as making the inner commitment to start creating a life of enhanced purpose.</p><p>What changes could you make, today, to start that process? Is there a passion, or calling, that you sense on the periphery of your awareness? What could you do in order to start honoring that? Remember, purpose doesn’t have to be elaborate or grand.</p><p>Applying Kamiya’s work, you could journal and answer the two questions: what is my existence for? What is the purpose of my existence? Don’t think about it too much, just see what surfaces.</p><p>Additionally, consider what things in life are the source of ikigai, or when are the moments when you feel ikigai-kan. For me, writing is the source of both. Although now established as a writer, in the beginning, it started with a commitment to write a little every day.</p><h3 id=\"pillar-two-releasing-yourself\">Pillar Two: Releasing Yourself</h3><p>This pillar demonstrates how deep the philosophy of ikigai is, and its entanglement with other Eastern philosophies that have stood the test of time, such as Buddhism. </p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Buddhism\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"baf83\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/buddhism.jpg?id=51946000&amp;width=980\" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure><p>Releasing yourself means to let go of all the things in life you hold onto, that cause some form of suffering.</p><p>It’s similar to the Buddhist practices of non-attachment. Are you attached to your self-image, what other people think of you, or always thinking about a time you’ll finally be happy?</p><p>Releasing yourself requires accepting where you’re at, who you are, and the moment in front of you. It leads to a state of peaceful surrender, going with the flow, rather than grappling with life.</p><p>Ikigai is, after all, a practice of aligning with nature. “The greatest secret of the ikigai, ultimately, has to be the acceptance of oneself, no matter what kind of unique features one might happen to be born with,” Mogi writes.</p><h3 id=\"pillar-three-harmony-and-sustainability\">Pillar Three: Harmony and Sustainability</h3><p>This step is connected to your environment. Ikigai incorporates the people in our lives, our immediate community, the quality and sustainability of all living things we interact with.</p><p>As Mogi says, “A man is like a forest; individual and yet connected and dependent on others for growth.” Harmony and sustainability are both inner and outer experiences, reflected in your emotions, your thoughts, the way you interact with the world, the way you go about your work.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"a man is like a forest\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c07ba\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/a-man-is-like-a-forest.jpg?id=51945983&amp;width=980\" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure><p>Consider any area of life where there is disharmony. Perhaps you have a few relationships that cause friction, or you are pushing yourself to extremes, unable to sustain that approach to hustle culture for the long term. In what ways can you invite a more peaceful approach? How can you be the source of harmony, for yourself, and for the wider world around you?</p><p>That doesn’t have to mean being half-hearted in what you do, quite the opposite, as ikigai encourages commitment and passion in equal measure. But make sure not to fall into traps of seriousness, and keep an explorative, playful attitude to yourself, your relationships, your community, and your work.</p><h3 id=\"pillar-four-the-joy-of-little-things\">Pillar Four: The Joy of Little Things</h3><p>Ikigai is a comprehensive philosophy, as well as being an antidote to a lot of modern approaches to finding happiness through constant striving, or the craving for success or recognition.</p><p>Deeply embedded in the Japanese concept is finding joy in little things. Your morning coffee. A smile from a stranger. An unexpected spell of sunshine. A message from a friend you’ve not spoken to in a while. A delicious sip of energizing green tea. All of these are opportunities to enjoy small sparks of joy, sparks that pave the way for a life in honor of ikigai.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"green tea\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b96f5\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/green-tea.jpg?id=51945998&amp;width=980\" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure><p>As Kamiya notes, those dedicated to ikigai spend all their days in fulfillment. Yes, there might be a challenging process of realizing your calling, and adjusting your life to make sure you have supreme focus on fulfilling your potential. But ikigai isn’t about the end destination, it’s about smelling the flowers on the way.</p><p>The easiest way to do this is to look for gratitude in your life. What things bring you a sense of comfort? What in your life would you have never predicted or thought you’d be able to achieve? What have you overcome? Who adds laughter or who supports you? All of these reflections of gratitude support the feeling of ikigai-kan.</p><h3 id=\"h-pillar-five-being-in-the-here-and-now\">Pillar Five: Being in the Here and Now</h3><p>To reaffirm the intention of ikigai, and its link to mindfulness, the final pillar reminds us to be present. To pause. To become fully aware of what’s directly in front of us. To take things one step at a time, and notice when our minds get caught in the past, or jump ahead to the future. The more present you become, the richer life is, the more nourishing each moment, and the less fearful you become about uncertain futures.</p><p>The irony of trying to find happiness is that it keeps us always looking ahead, waiting for a moment to come. But as many Eastern philosophies have taught, that is an illusion. Only the present ever exists. And the more you’re able to truly arrive in the present moment, the more likely you will be to experience deeper fulfillment.</p><p>Ikigai is a philosophy that reminds us that, with a brief pause, a moment of gratitude for the small things, acceptance for who we are and where we’re at. Then you might end up finding purpose where you never expected it — right in front of you.</p><p>Right here, right now. </p><p><a href=\"https://positivepsychology.com/ikigai/\" target=\"_blank\">If you have any unanswered questions click here, and good luck on your journey!</a></p>",

In these discarded leaves lies a gift for your garden; they are a natural, free, and potent fertiliser waiting to be unlocked. Leaf mulching is an art as much as it is a science, turning what most people consider waste into a treasure trove for healthy soil.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Imagine walking into your balcony or small garden in early winter, noticing that the beds are covered with a soft, earthy layer of leaves. Beneath this blanket, the soil is quietly changing, retaining moisture, suppressing weeds, and nurturing life from the tiniest microbe to your beloved plants.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The magic of leaf mulching lies not in complicated machinery or chemical concoctions but in a patient rhythm with nature.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why your garden will thank you</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Leaves are nature&rsquo;s own compost packets. As they break down, they release essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium into the soil. The organic matter improves soil structure, encourages beneficial microorganisms, and creates a spongy layer that holds water during dry spells.

It is a practice that supports not just plants, but a sense of connection to the natural world.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">How to start your leaf mulch journey</h2>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Collect with care</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Begin with a <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/gardening/october-pruning-guide-indian-gardens-pruning-trees-shrubs-maintenance-home-gardening-tricks-10590306\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">walk around your garden</a>, terrace, or nearby neighbourhood. Gather fallen leaves, choosing those that are healthy and free from disease. If some are damp or curled, don&rsquo;t worry, they will still decompose, though shredding them first speeds up the process. For urban gardeners, a pair of scissors or a lawnmower can turn bulky leaves into manageable pieces.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Shredding: The secret to quick decomposition</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shredded leaves fit snugly around your plants and also decompose faster. Picture them as puzzle pieces; the smaller the pieces, the faster they integrate into the soil. This simple step turns a pile of leaves into a living, breathing layer of humus.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Layer leaves to feed your soil</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Spread a modest layer of shredded leaves, about two to three inches, over the soil. Avoid over-piling; think of it as tucking your garden in for winter. Lightly mixing the leaves with the top layer of soil encourages microbial activity, and over time, these tiny gardeners will turn the leaves into dark and crumbly goodness.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. Water and nurture</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After laying down the mulch, give it a gentle watering. This simple act helps settle the leaves, kickstarts decomposition, and <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/farming/restore-soil-after-monsoon-natural-soil-recharging-compost-soil-fertility-healthy-crops-post-rains-10507957\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">keeps the soil moist</a>.

The triumph lies not in picking the produce, but in knowing how to preserve it, so its flavours and vitality survive through winter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With practical methods that combine time-honoured wisdom and easy household solutions, you can turn your fall harvest into a pantry treasure trove. This guide will walk you through the nuances of harvesting and storing your garden&rsquo;s bounty:</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Knowing when to harvest</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Harvesting at the right moment is essential. Crops left in the soil too long risk losing freshness and flavour, while picking too early may mean sacrificing quality and storability.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">For root vegetables like carrots, radishes and sweet potatoes, observe their shoulders protruding slightly above the soil; they should feel firm and well-developed.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/259690/how-to-home-garden-aurangabad-organic-vegetables-facebook/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Leafy greens</a> should be picked when leaves have reached full size but remain tender and bright.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fruits such as guavas, pomegranates, and other fall crops are ripe when their skin is dark-coloured, firm, and gives slightly under gentle pressure.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"harvesting and storing autumn crops\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/harvesting-and-storing-autumn-crops-2025-10-28-22-01-12.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Fruits such as guavas, pomegranates, and other fall crops are ripe when their skin is dark-coloured and can be harvested. Photograph: </em><a href=\"https://sikrifarms.com/organic-fertilizers-pomegranate?srsltid=AfmBOorbd09Gp7MR1d-OhLx6oa4nRzWnUsE9cr9Tg3lauujjr6hZUmCb\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>(Sikri Farms)</em></a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aim to harvest in the cool morning hours after the dew has evaporated. Dry conditions at harvest reduce moisture that could otherwise invite premature spoilage or mould growth.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Gentle harvesting preserves freshness</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The way you handle your produce post-harvest influences its shelf life. Bruises or cuts create entry points for decay.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Use sharp, clean tools such as garden knives or scissors to cut produce cleanly from the plant.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Avoid washing freshly harvested crops immediately; instead, gently brush away any soil. Washing can add unwelcome moisture, encouraging rot.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Place vegetables and fruits in shallow trays or baskets, avoiding heaping them into piles that could crush delicate produce.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Taking a little extra care now pays dividends in preserving quality for weeks or even months to come.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Creating the perfect storage environment at home</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many gardeners believe refrigeration is necessary for storing harvests, but with the right conditions, many crops can be kept fresh without it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Select a cool, dark, and dry space, such as a cellar, storeroom, or a shaded balcony, that remains well ventilated. Temperatures between 10&deg;C and 15&deg;C are ideal.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Root vegetables, such as potatoes, <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/250476/kerala-wayanad-organic-farmer-c-v-verghese-terrace-gardening-how-to-grow-organic-vegetables-vertical-mesh-tower-method-ros174/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">carrots, and sweet potatoes</a>, keep best when stored in boxes or crates layered with dry sand or sawdust. This helps maintain moisture balance, keeping them firm and crisp.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Leafy greens have a shorter lifespan but can be preserved by wrapping loosely in a damp muslin cloth and storing in the coolest part of the house or refrigerator for short-term use.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"harvesting and storing autumn crops\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/harvesting-and-storing-autumn-crops-2025-10-28-22-04-36.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Root vegetables, such as potatoes, carrots, and sweet potatoes, keep best when stored in boxes.

Traditional storage techniques for gardeners</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many time-tested methods from rural traditions remain invaluable for today&rsquo;s gardeners:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Evaporative cooling chambers, crafted from two nested clay pots with moist sand in between, create a natural cooling effect that prolongs freshness.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hanging dried vegetables and fruits in breathable cloth bags keeps produce away from pests and encourages airflow, preventing mould.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Storing pulses, grains and dried goods in earthenware pots lined with neem leaves acts as a natural insect repellent and maintains dryness.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These low-cost techniques can be replicated at home with materials readily available in most households.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Preparing crops for long-term storage</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Proper preparation is essential for extending shelf life:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Curing tubers like sweet potatoes involves keeping them in a warm, dry, airy place for several days. This thickens their skins, protecting them against rot.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Blanching leafy greens, briefly immersing them in boiling water before plunging into cold water, halts enzyme action that causes spoilage and helps retain colour and nutrients.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sun-drying slices of fruits and vegetables concentrates flavours and preserves them naturally. Make sure they are fully dry before storing in airtight containers to avoid mould.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Protecting your harvest: Pest and spoilage prevention</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even with excellent storage, vigilance is important:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Use <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/478831/monsoon-vegetable-garden-pest-control-tips-gardening-organic-solutions/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">natural repellents such as neem leaves</a>, dried chillies or garlic cloves placed among your stored crops to deter insects.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Inspect your stored produce regularly, removing any items showing signs of spoilage before they affect the rest.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Keep storage areas well ventilated to avoid the build-up of humidity, a common cause of mould and decay.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"harvesting and storing autumn crops\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/harvesting-and-storing-autumn-crops-2025-10-28-22-10-04.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Use natural repellents such as neem leaves, dried chillies or garlic cloves to deter pests.

This transitional period, characterised by cooler days and moderate humidity, creates ideal conditions for off-season farming.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For small-scale farmers, it presents a valuable opportunity to grow high-demand vegetables that command premium prices, while maximising land use and building a steady source of income.</p>\n<h2>Best vegetables to cultivate in autumn</h2>\n<h3>1. Spinach</h3>\n<p>Spinach is a nutrient-dense leafy vegetable that flourishes in the cool and moist conditions of autumn. Its rapid growth cycle of approximately 25 to 30 days means it can provide a quick return and multiple harvests in one season. Rich in iron and vitamins, it enjoys year-round demand in both households and markets.</p>\n<p><strong>How to grow:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prepare well-drained, fertile soil enriched with organic compost to retain moisture yet avoid waterlogging.</li>\n<li>Sow seeds thinly at about one centimetre depth directly into the soil beds.</li>\n<li>Water regularly every two to three days, making sure the soil remains moist but not soggy.</li>\n<li>Once seedlings reach a few centimetres in height, thin them to allow five to seven centimetres spacing for healthy leaf development.</li>\n<li>Harvest outer leaves carefully to encourage continuous regrowth, allowing multiple pickings over several weeks.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Off-season farming\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/off-season-farming-2025-10-28-14-15-34.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Spinach is a nutrient-dense leafy vegetable that flourishes in the cool conditions.

Fenugreek</h3>\n<p>Fenugreek, valued both as a <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/259690/how-to-home-garden-aurangabad-organic-vegetables-facebook/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">leafy vegetable</a> and for its medicinal qualities, prospers in autumn&rsquo;s moderate temperatures. It grows rapidly and requires minimal inputs, making it ideal for small farmers. Its distinctive aroma and flavour make it a staple in many kitchens.</p>\n<p><strong>How to grow:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Broadcast seeds evenly over well-tilled soil and lightly cover with a thin layer of earth.</li>\n<li>Maintain consistent moisture by watering gently every alternate day.</li>\n<li>Germination usually occurs within seven days.</li>\n<li>Cut the leaves about two centimetres above the base after 20 to 25 days to allow for regrowth and multiple harvests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. Radish</h3>\n<p>Radish is a fast-growing root vegetable that matures within 30 to 40 days, surviving in the cool and gentle conditions of autumn. Its crisp texture and peppery flavour make it a favourite, while its quick turnaround makes it a profitable choice.</p>\n<p><strong>How to grow:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Select loose, sandy or loamy soil to facilitate unrestricted root growth.</li>\n<li>Sow seeds directly in shallow rows, about one centimetre deep, spacing seeds two to three centimetres apart.</li>\n<li>Once seedlings sprout, thin them to five centimetres spacing to allow room for bulb development.</li>\n<li>Keep soil moist consistently, avoiding waterlogging to prevent rot.</li>\n<li>Harvest roots when they are tender and firm, before they become woody and overly pungent.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4. Carrot</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/496839/punjab-farmer-phuman-singh-carrot-farming-earns-crores/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Carrots, prized for their sweetness</a> and crunch, perform exceptionally well in autumn&rsquo;s cooler climate, which enhances their flavour. Although carrots require a longer growing period of 60 to 70 days, the resulting crop commands strong market prices.</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Off-season farming\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/off-season-farming-2025-10-28-14-18-35.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Harvest carrots when roots reach the desired size and firmness.

Coriander</h3>\n<p>Coriander is a fragrant herb essential to many culinary traditions and grows swiftly during autumn. Both the fresh leaves and seeds are valued, providing dual harvest potential.</p>\n<p><strong>How to grow:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lightly crush seeds before sowing to improve germination rates.</li>\n<li>Sow thinly in well-drained soil beds and cover seeds lightly.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/477793/self-watering-planter-osmos-gowtham-reddy-hyderabad/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Water gently every day</a> or two to keep the soil moist.</li>\n<li>Thin seedlings to five centimetres apart to avoid overcrowding.</li>\n<li>Leaves can be harvested within three to four weeks; allow some plants to flower and produce seeds for a later harvest.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>6. Cauliflower</h3>\n<p>Cauliflower is a cool-season crop that develops best in autumn when temperatures are mild. It is prized for its firm, white curds and commands premium prices, particularly during off-season periods.</p>\n<p><strong>How to grow:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start seedlings in a nursery for three to four weeks to certify strong and healthy plants.</li>\n<li>Prepare raised beds with fertile, well-draining soil and transplant seedlings at 45 to 60 cm spacing.</li>\n<li>Provide ample sunlight and maintain consistent moisture with regular watering.</li>\n<li>Apply organic fertilisers, such as well-rotted manure or compost tea, to encourage robust growth.</li>\n<li>Protect developing curds from harsh sunlight by loosely tying outer leaves over the heads if needed to prevent yellowing.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Off-season farming\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/off-season-farming-2025-10-28-14-25-59.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Cauliflower is a cool-season crop that develops best in autumn.

It is the <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/gardening/autumn-gardening-tips-for-spring-garden-care-guide-for-healthy-bloom-takeaway-tricks-10553164\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">season of renewal</a>, when the soil, still warm beneath gentle skies, becomes a canvas for cool-weather crops. Among the most rewarding to sow now are peas and beans.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They are unassuming little seeds that promise abundance, nourishment and a touch of rustic elegance to any garden. Brimming with natural protein and dynamism, these verdant climbers are as pleasing to the eye as they are to the palate.</p>\n<h2>The charm of Autumn sowing</h2>\n<p>Autumn&rsquo;s mild climate and softened sunlight create the ideal conditions for peas and beans. The soil remains pliant and rich from the monsoon&rsquo;s generosity, while cooler days favour strong and steady growth. This balance of warmth and freshness helps seeds germinate swiftly and plants flourish without the stress of scorching heat.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Choose your varieties wisely</h3>\n<p>The secret to a flourishing crop lies in the seed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Peas: Choose quick-growing types such as garden peas, snow peas or sugar snaps. These survive in temperate weather and offer a sweet and tender yield.</li>\n<li>Beans: Opt for French beans if you prefer compact bushes, or runner beans if you fancy elegant climbers that drape beautifully along a trellis.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Sowing peas and beans\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/sowing-peas-and-beans-2025-10-28-18-31-12.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Autumn&rsquo;s mild climate and softened sunlight create the ideal conditions for peas and beans.

Peas and beans prosper in friable, <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/446695/grow-amla-in-pots-container-gardening-indian-gooseberry-gardening-steps-grow-in-compact-spaces/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fertile soil with excellent drainage</a>. Loosen the soil to a depth of about 20 to 25 centimetres and blend in generous amounts of compost or well-rotted manure. Though legumes enrich the earth by fixing nitrogen, they still appreciate a nutrient-rich start.</p>\n<p>Avoid recently used plots where other legumes grew; the soil may harbour pests or depleted elements that could stunt new plants.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Sow with care</h3>\n<p>Sow once the harsh sun has mellowed and the soil feels comfortably warm to the touch.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Peas: Plant seeds two to three centimetres deep, leaving about five centimetres between each.</li>\n<li>Beans: Set them slightly deeper, around three to four centimetres, with 15 to 20 centimetres between plants and roughly half a metre between rows.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your soil tends to retain water, create raised beds to keep the roots from drowning. A moist, not soggy, surface is ideal for germination.</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Sowing peas and beans\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/sowing-peas-and-beans-2025-10-28-18-36-28.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Choose quick-growing types such as garden peas, snow peas, or sugar snaps for better yield. Photograph: </em><a href=\"https://www.koppert.in/crops/arable-crops/pea/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>(Koppert India)</em></a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>Step 4: Provide sturdy support</h3>\n<p>Peas and climbing beans are natural adventurers; give them something to ascend. Bamboo poles, garden netting or wooden frames make excellent supports. Setting these up at the time of sowing <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/466731/monsoon-gardening-tips-india-rainy-season-vegetable-garden-care-how-to-take-care-of-plants/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">prevents damage to tender roots</a> later. Bush beans, by contrast, remain neat and upright, needing no assistance beyond good spacing.</p>\n<h3>Step 5: Water thoughtfully</h3>\n<p>Consistency in watering is crucial. Keep the soil evenly moist, especially during flowering and pod formation. Water early in the morning to allow leaves to dry through the day, reducing the risk of fungal disease. A mulch of straw or dry leaves will conserve moisture and suppress unwelcome weeds.</p>\n<h3>Step 6: Feed and protect</h3>\n<p>Although peas and beans are self-reliant, a mild organic feed at the onset of flowering can enhance their yield. Watch for aphids or leaf miners; a natural neem spray or gentle soap solution will deter them effectively. <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/429250/grow-lychee-at-home-indian-cities-home-gardening-steps-climate-soil-lychee-cultivation/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Good airflow and sunlight</a> are the simplest guardians against most ailments.</p>\n<h3>Step 7: Harvest at their prime</h3>\n<p>The joy of harvesting lies in timing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Peas: Pick when pods are plump yet tender, before the seeds harden.</li>\n<li>Beans: Gather when they are slender and firm but still supple to the touch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Harvest regularly because the more you pick, the more the plant produces.</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Sowing peas and beans\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/sowing-peas-and-beans-2025-10-28-18-39-55.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Peas and beans prosper in friable, fertile soil with excellent drainage.

Their roots hold nitrogen that <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/490257/scientist-shitarashmi-sahu-transforms-rourkela-steel-industry-slag-waste-into-fertiliser/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">enriches the soil</a> naturally. Turn the remaining foliage into compost or gently mix it into the bed to prepare for your next planting.</p>\n<h2>Essential takeaways for a flourishing autumn garden</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Start early:</strong> Sow as soon as the days begin to cool.</li>\n<li><strong>Seek sunlight:</strong> Peas and beans need at least five hours of direct light each day.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep soil moist:</strong> Never let it dry out completely.</li>\n<li><strong>Support climbers:</strong> A trellis or pole structure supports healthy growth.</li>\n<li><strong>Feed organically:</strong> <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/sustainability/puja-waste-at-home-easy-tips-to-turn-flowers-leftover-food-into-compost-for-home-garden-10502428\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rely on compost</a> rather than chemical fertilisers.</li>\n<li><strong>Harvest often:</strong> Regular picking promotes steady production.</li>\n</ul>",

Whether it’s a dog or a cat, pets offer unconditional love, the ability to lower stress, and the opportunity to build a community with other pet lovers. Pets support our mental health in dozens of ways, every single day. But how do we care for them in return? </p><p>In partnership with Nulo, we’re celebrating Pet Wellness Month this October by highlighting the small, meaningful ways pet parents fuel their fur babies’ happiness and health. We asked readers: “What’s one small thing you do that makes a big difference for your pet?” The best answers win a custom pet portrait, a wellness care package courtesy of Nulo, and a donation to their local pet shelter. </p><p>Of all the hilarious and heartfelt answers we got, three of them stood out. Here are the winning responses and three examples of how you, too, can make a huge difference for your pet in small, simple ways. </p><h3>Keeping their bodies strong</h3><br /><img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"57c29\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk3NjEzNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODQxMzI3MH0.b8s0mbksFwTDNnMR8VUJ5PcFiD0z2FtuySP5P3aAwKM/img.jpg?width=980\" /><p>Meet Tee: He’s a loyal, playful ball of energy that helps his owner, Jailon, by bringing joy and calm to his life every day. To show Tee love, Jailon prioritizes physical health and emotional wellness. For exercise, Jailon makes sure Tee has daily walks, playtime, and making sure his diet is balanced with high-quality, nutritious food (Nulo being one of his favorites). </p>\n<p>But emotional wellness is equally important. “One small thing I do that makes a big difference for my pet is setting aside dedicated connection time every day,” Jailon says. “No phones, no distractions, just us. The time helps us bond and keeps Tee’s mind active and healthy.”</p><h3>Communication is key</h3><br /><img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"6dbd8\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk3NjA2NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgwMTk4MjA0NH0.e0Bj3enfivWYQ1D7MK_Q2tmv9dW2uweqauE1SZeOdlc/img.jpg?width=980\" /><p>Mary Ann’s dog Aiden was rescued from her local Humane Society, and as a former stray, the beginning of their relationship wasn’t always easy. </p>\n<p>“Aiden was so scared that he would sleep in a corner or under a bed. My husband and I had to sleep with him on the floor until we gained his trust,” Mary Ann said. To soothe his separation anxiety, Mary Ann started talking to him regularly.</p>\n<p>“I started telling him, ‘mommy is going to work,’ or ‘mommy will be back’ and he started to understand,” she said. </p>\n<p>Amazingly, Aiden responded. Now, his anxiety has improved and their bond is stronger than ever. Aiden still relishes the gentle words of affirmation that Mary Ann continues to give him. </p><p>“His face is so expressive and his smile melts our hearts,” she said. “We get him to fall asleep by repeatedly telling him, ‘I love you, Aiden.’”</p><h3>Building them a place to call home</h3><br /><img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"3f7cf\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk4OTQ2NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5NDAwNDM2N30.nBfrxb3XdF0mbaFhxTm5y-iBXNfCLI2Xr7qY6q_F6Rg/img.jpg?width=980\" /><p>Our feline friends need love, too. That’s why Amber created a cozy habitat for her longhair tuxedo cat, Precious, on the nights where she likes to roam. Adopted from a local shelter eight years ago, Precious is now 16—and not fond of staying indoors. </p><p>“In her old age, Precious has become very anxious being inside,” Amber said. Even in the cold winter months, Precious prefers staying outside on their back deck or exploring their 10-acre property. “She usually refuses to come inside, even on cold nights,” Amber said. </p><p>After many failed attempts to get her inside for the evening, Amber and her family realized it would be unfair to keep her confined when she wasn’t comfortable. As a compromise, Amber’s handy husband built a safe haven for her outside. </p><p>“She couldn't just have a tiny little box. Our girl was too good for that,” Amber said. “Now we can rest easy at night knowing she is safe, warm, and secure in her own private bungalow.” </p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"96964\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk4OTQ1OC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3ODE1NTIyMn0.zE1xb1OZ45KohbCQocMJDQp7A-0V_8MSvTBYwPOBr6U/img.png?width=980\" /><p>Showing love for your pets—especially in the form of regular exercise, safe surroundings and good nutrition—is the best way to keep them happy and healthy for as long as possible. And when we help our pets live longer, we’re nurturing the connection that makes our lives richer, too.</p><p class=\"\"><br /><em><strong>Good nutrition is the cornerstone of a happy pet.

It's a living, breathing network of connections and shared experiences. While it's usually defined as “a group of people living in the same place or having a particular characteristic in common,” true community runs much deeper than that.\n</p><p><strong>Diversity</strong></p><p>\n\tIt doesn’t matter how different we are. What matters in building a community is the desire to live in a peaceful and caring environment, despite all our differences.Good Neighbors<br />\n</p><p><strong>Good Neighbors</strong><br /></p><p>\n\tWhen searching for a new place to call home, we hope to stumble upon neighbors who can transform a neighborhood into something meaningful. We all need to be surrounded by people who genuinely care for the well-being of others. Only this type of people can create a community that is more than just a bunch of individuals living next to each other.\n</p><p><strong>It Starts with One</strong><br /></p><p>\n\tBuilding a strong community starts with individual contributions, no matter how small. As long as you are kind and willing to help others in need, you’ll be a great community member.

I called my mom, who is in a senior living home, and asked if her facility did this. Her answer was surprising: \"I hope not. Where would I even get candy?\"</p><p>But the idea is still a lovely one, at least for some. And if it's something that resonates, here are a few tips for making it work.</p>  <h2>NOTE THE SENIOR FACILITY</h2><p>There's a big difference between senior independent living, assisted living, and memory care. It's important to note that before attempting a visit which includes children. Senior independent would probably be the best place to start, as the residents (often) have fewer physical or memory-health issues.</p>  <h2>CALL AHEAD</h2><p>This might take some time, but call around to different facilities to make sure this is allowed. Usually, this is a planned event on their part, so while they may love the idea, it certainly takes coordination. The site, <a href=\"https://www.aplaceformom.com/lp?&amp;kw=3234-APFM:NB:USA:GOOGLE:Misc:Exact&amp;kwg=&amp;keyword=living%20centers%20near%20me&amp;match=e&amp;device=c&amp;network=g&amp;hcinquiry=&amp;account=Google:APFM:HMI&amp;campaignid=21291296783&amp;adgroupid=161053958783&amp;ad_id=699465812850&amp;geo=9030971&amp;targetID=kwd-379238823828&amp;hl=&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=paid_media_sem&amp;utm_campaign=APFM:NB:USA:GOOGLE:Misc:Exact&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=living%20centers%20near%20me&amp;attribution_id=155&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21291296783&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADkMj5LraGz6BJrudl9WlbYgrYftu&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw9obIBhCAARIsAGHm1mQuwP40BAee7ghBOdgtWQy7UlChEBQK8cF2g9gf29ZEQxSO49AOkgUaAi2AEALw_wcB\" target=\"_blank\">A Place for Mom </a>can offer a list of nearby residences.</p><h2>OFFER A DONATION </h2><p>Getting out and getting candy (or having the funds to do so) should also be a consideration for something like this. One idea is that once you've established that a facility is hosting an event like this (and/or is open to it), consider offering money to buy the actual candy. Or one could drop the candy off. </p>",

He also suffers from ingrown toenails that are so severe he’s had two nails on his biggest toes permanently removed.</p><p>Last year, the family was lucky enough to stumble upon five pairs of size 21 shoes at a Nike outlet store. It was discovered they were <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/2zpndy-if-the-shoe-fits\" target=\"_blank\">made especially for Tacko Fall</a>, the NBA player with some of the most enormous feet in the game.

With the spotlight, his family launched the Big Shoe Network to help others facing similar challenges finding gear that fits.</p><p><em><span></span>This article originally appeared last year. </em></p>",

But according to some of the students who have participated, the hike isn't exactly a walk in the park compared to just sitting around. </p><p>“Sometimes the hike feels really like a punishment for them, even though they've chosen it,” Trundy told <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/26/nx-s1-5437873/at-this-school-kids-given-detention-can-choose-a-hike-instead\" target=\"_blank\"><u>NPR</u></a>. “Like, they might've chosen it 'cause it was a lessening sentence, but it did feel like they were having to expend effort.”</p><p>Nicholas Tanguay, a student who was assigned detention for yelling at a teacher, concurred. But he also said the hiking offers an opportunity to reflect in a way that detention in a classroom doesn't. </p><p>\"It makes me have to, like, walk. It makes it makes you breathe heavily, obviously, and it feels like an accomplishment, almost,\" the student said. \"I think that maybe it's also good for people's mental health. I mean, in general, nature and hikes are just really good for people's mentality. So...maybe you've had a bad day, the option to do this after knowing you have a detention means you have to dread it less.\"</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"hiking, teens, high school, detention, outdoors\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ba8f7\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk5MDE3Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODY1NzY3MH0.ApYT1Se1fMxgJTeKq4tmUzXfLDlsTd8m1RVQj6cFV70/img.jpg?width=980\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Time in nature is good for everyone.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos\" target=\"_blank\">Photo credit: Canva</a></small></p><p>Dreading detention less may not seem like the desired outcome—dreading detention is kind of the whole point of detention—but the question we need to ask is whether hiking is a more effective way of altering student behavior than traditional punishment. </p><p>Kids misbehave for many reasons, some of which may better be addressed with time outdoors, physical exercise, mentoring by a caring adult, and a sense of community than by sitting for three hours doing nothing. In fact, some of the students who have done the hiking detention have since joined Trundy's outdoor club, going on hikes that aren't required and gaining the benefits of them of their own accord. </p><p>Time will tell how effective the program is as Trundy gathers data, but in the meantime, people have opinions. Some feel that alternative programs like this weaken the consequences for bad behavior, making students less likely to comply with rules. Others see a lot of value in the approach, giving kids who act out a healthy place to process, which may lead to better behavior over time. </p><p>But what most people seem to agree on, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SamBentley/posts/pfbid02E6zdMzP5qQiYfxtHPpTaXwU7T6Q2hMzG7Au2nFG1p64o8CfEF7gBjiHwsUgkBSZPl\" target=\"_blank\">based on comments about this program</a>, is that young people need more time outdoors in general:</p><p>\"I think the real answer is that kids of all ages need recess/outdoor time. A lot of my middle schoolers aren’t awful; they just have energy to burn and would benefit from running around for fifteen minutes every day.\"</p><p>\"Maybe nature hikes and outdoor brain breaks could be offered as part of the school day for all students. I bet we’d see fewer kids in detention. The microbiome of trees and plants works with our own biology to reduce anxiety, depression. Time outdoors has shown to help reduce ADHD symptoms and improve focus. When we take recess away or don’t offer outdoor time, we exacerbate problems.\"</p><p>\"Being out in nature improves executive function, improves mood, enhances memory and self control.I think improving connection with self, nature and others is what's going to improve so much for kids who are struggling in school environments.\"</p><p>\"Maybe add dogs to walk from a local shelter for even more positive results.\" (Now there's an idea.)</p><p>Considering how many students get detention multiple times, trying an alternative to help them regulate themselves and make better choices probably isn't a bad idea. Here's to educators trying innovative approaches to help students reach their fullest potential. </p>",

The show was enormously popular and put Chappelle on the map. <em>Chappelle’s Show</em> was scheduled to have a third season after the success of the first two seasons but that never happened. </p><h4>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/why-dave-chappelle-walked-away-from-50-million-dollars/\">Why Dave Chappelle Walked Away From $50 Million Dollars …</a></h4><p>Instead, Chappelle famously walked away from the series and a $50 million paycheck. He abruptly left during production in 2006, effectively breaking his contract with Comedy Central. He was reportedly unhappy with the direction the show had taken and needed to step away.</p><p>But there has been one person who has been with the comedian through it all and that's his wife, Elaine.</p><h2>Dave and Elaine Chappelle Prioritize Family Over Money</h2><p>In an interview with <em><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20050516081506/https:/www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1061415,00.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Time</a></em>, Chappelle spoke about moving to Ohio and walking away from his show, saying, \"Coming here, I don't have the distractions of fame. It quiets the ego down. I'm interested in the kind of person I've got to become. I want to be well-rounded, and the industry is a place of extremes. I want to be well-balanced. I've got to check my intentions, man.”</p><h4>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/best-dating-quotes/\">Best Dating Quotes to to Keep You Motivated in Your Search for Love</a></h4><p>There was much speculation during this time in Chappelle’s life. Fans couldn’t fathom the idea that he’d walk away from his popular and successful show and $50 million. People thought he must have a drug or alcohol problem. Others thought it was a mental health issue that led comedian Dave Chappelle to walk away from it all. That wasn’t the case at all. Chappelle simply reprioritized his life in a way that was better for himself and his family.</p><p>Through the media circus that followed Dave Chappelle’s wife Elaine Mendoza stood by him. Dave and Elaine have been married for 21 years. They tied the knot in 2001 and have two sons, Sulayman and Ibrahim, and one daughter, Sanaa. </p><h2><strong>Who is Elaine Chappelle</strong>?</h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"elaine chappell\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ef5f6\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/elaine-chappell.png?id=55368792&amp;width=980\" />\n<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Goalcast Archive</small></p>\n<p>Dave Chappelle’s wife Elaine Mendoza was born on August 31, 1974, to devout Christian Filipino parents. (Dave converted to Islam in 1991.) She grew up in Brooklyn and according to various sources, once planned to become a professional chef. Dave and Elaine Chappelle met more than 20 years ago, so she would have been in her 20s. After meeting and falling in love with Dave Chappelle, Elaine chose to devote herself to raising the couple’s three children.</p><h2><strong>How Did Dave Chappelle and Elaine Meet?</strong></h2><div><strong><br /></strong></div><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"dave with his arm around his wife elaine chappell\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"2ca0d\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/dave-with-his-arm-around-his-wife-elaine-chappell.png?id=55368800&amp;width=980\" />\n<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Goalcast Archive</small></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"></figure><p>During an interview with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81yCzWkt8uM\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Howard Stern</a> in the early 2000s, Dave Chappelle revealed that he met his then-girlfriend Elaine Mendoza in Brooklyn and at the time he said she was pregnant with his baby. He said that he was immediately interested in her, but she took some time to get to know Dave before committing to the relationship. </p><h4>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/dave-chappelle-talks-worst-experience-video/\">Dave Chappelle Talks About His Worst Experience</a></h4><p>He also revealed that she was Filipino, which led Stern and his co-host Robin Quivers to make some distasteful jokes about Asian stereotypes. Up until this point Dave Chappelle had been a regular guest on Stern’s show and even credited the exposure Stern gave him with helping his career. After they made those so-called jokes about the future Elaine Chappelle, he has continually refused to ever appear on Stern’s show again. Though he publicly says it’s because the show <a href=\"https://www.thethings.com/why-dave-chappelle-wont-do-the-howard-stern-show-again/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tapes too early in the morning</a>, it feels like he's showing where his loyalties lie – with his wife Elaine Chappelle.</p><h2><strong>Elaine is Dave Chappelle’s Support System</strong></h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"dave chappelle during a comedy routine\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8e22c\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/dave-chappelle-during-a-comedy-routine.png?id=55368803&amp;width=980\" />\n<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Goalcast Archive</small></p>\n<p><br /></p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"></figure><p>Dave and Elaine Chappelle have a strong marriage that has lasted more than two decades so far.

In his final interview with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81yCzWkt8uM\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Howard Stern</a>, Chappelle said, “She was with me when I was poor.”</p><p>For a celebrity like Chappelle, it is especially important to have a strong support system in place. Fans and the media can be brutal to a public figure like Elaine Chappelle’s husband. She has been with Dave through some rocky parts of his career including when he walked away from <em>Chappelle’s Show</em> and the more recent controversy over the <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/dave-chappelle-transphobic-jokes-the-closer-emmy-nomination-1381734/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">anti-trans content</a> in his standup routine. </p><h4>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/relationship-goals-justin-timberlake-and-jessica-biel/\">Relationship Goals: Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel Stepped Back to Leap Forward</a></h4><p>He appreciates the perspective Elaine Chappelle brings to his life and said, \"My wife, if it gets real bad, she’ll let me know, like, ‘Oh, you should look into this.’ But for the most part, I try not to pay attention to it because you don’t want to be careful as a comedian. I try to keep my business small enough so it can still be authentic enough.”</p><p>Speaking of that $50 million Chappelle walked away from when he quit <em>Chapelle’s Show</em> and voided his contract with Comedy Central – Chappelle did an interview with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-4nPqn7Jo\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Conan O’Brien</a> in 2006 during which he talked about it, saying,  “My wife’s still a little salty… She’s not mad at me, but don’t think you’re going to walk away from $50 million and your wife’s just gonna be cool with it.”</p><h2 id=\"h-where-the-married-couple-is-today\"><strong>Where the Married Couple is Today</strong></h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"dave chappelle and his wife elaine\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b6592\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/dave-chappelle-and-his-wife-elaine.png?id=55368806&amp;width=980\" />\n<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Goalcast Archive</small></p><p>Dave and Elaine Chappelle and their three children live on a 65-acre farm in Yellow Springs, Ohio, which is located about 20 miles from the Dayton Metropolitan area.

No iPads</h3><p><em>“All I’m going to say is my kid has a whole world to explore and none of that has to do with being stuck in front of a tablet.”</em></p><h3>2. No smartphone until high school</h3><p><em>“Kids that are younger than that age do not know internet safety to a point where I feel comfortable letting them have free reign of the internet.”</em></p>   <h3>3. Teaching the value of education</h3><p><em>“What I’m going to teach them is [education] has nothing to do with how much money you’re making or how successful you’ll be professionally. But you will still value it, nonetheless. You will go with it as far as you possibly can, and then once you’re done with it, you can do whatever you want.”</em></p><h3>4. Respect your teachers and treat them well</h3><p><em>“This may be biased because I am a teacher, but everyone who has gone through a professional degree program and has put in the time and is there, giving you the quality education, deserves some type of attention and deserves to be treated well.”</em></p><p><em><br /></em></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e3a87\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk4OTUyOC9vcmlnaW4uZ2lmIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5MDk1ODY4NH0.WpMNyaTRUsnXhcLHgfLWhAxP-msKTezPLu0uFMKgdsk/img.gif?width=980\" />                <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">                <a href=\"https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExZzZoNDN6aWswamthMnNnbWY3cWowdnNncnJkanMwcGN2ZzFqNXdoaSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/lQPHNPMPZ7tcIwseGn/giphy.gif\" target=\"_blank\">media3.giphy.com</a>        </small>        </p><h3>5. Be kind to elderly folks</h3><p><em>“If they’re on public transportation and they’re sitting down and there’s an old lady standing next to them and there are no other seats available, my child will know to stand up and give that lady his seat.”</em></p><h3>6. Yes, ma’am</h3><p><em>“It does not matter your age or status in society, as long as they are respecting their pronouns, that’s how we’re gonna be talking to other people.”</em></p><h3>7. Greetings and gratitude</h3><p><em>“Simple greetings and simple terms of gratitude are just not being taught like they used to. I think it’s really sad.”</em></p><h3>8. Consequences for poor behavior</h3><p><em>“If they’re neglecting their schoolwork and not doing what they’re supposed to do, they get their technology taken away. … Simple things like this are pretty common sense and I’m not sure why they’re not being done anymore.”</em></p><h3>9. Respect adult conversations and spaces</h3><p><em>“They don’t get to interrupt 2 adults speaking to each other. They don’t get to come and butt in at an inappropriate time when 2 people are talking to each other.\"</em></p><h3>10. Clean your mess</h3><p><em>“My child is going to put as much work in the house as we are regardless of whether he’s paying rent out of his own pocket or not. That’s because when my son becomes an adult, I want him to be a partner or a spouse or a roommate that someone is proud to have around.”</em></p><p><em><br /></em></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f2bdc\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk4OTUxOC9vcmlnaW4uZ2lmIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NTc0Mjk5NH0.ucQ0_c390MdXUGPuXZKMBE4mJ7lq5Nov_aipgTETXiY/img.gif?width=980\" />                <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">                <a href=\"https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExOW9hcGF4aDNjdGZ0Z204dnhqc253eHU4Ynp1NXFnODdtbnIwZGs0YyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/HIrYP4RI9DpLy/giphy.gif\" target=\"_blank\">media3.giphy.com</a>        </small>        </p><h3>11.

My daughter is only 1, so she only has a few words that she says, but she says 'hi' very clearly, with a wave, and will say hi and wave to literally anyone and everyone, and virtually everyone responds very positively. And there's always just kind of an instant rapport with other parents that you meet in your day-to-day, where it's like, I have no idea if we have anything else in common, but this one important thing is something we share.

The Goonies' antics serve as a sharp contrast with today's kids, who seem to be wrapped in bubble wrap and closely monitored by their parents. It also shows the fun that kids can have when they spend their time outdoors, instead of on screens. </p><p>The Generation Goonie trend is taking off on TikTok, where many younger Gen Xers and older millennials proudly embrace the title.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>                <blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@its_me____stefanie/video/7455865482210643246\" class=\"tiktok-embed\">\n        <section>\n            <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@its_me____stefanie\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@its_me____stefanie\">@its_me____stefanie</a>\n            <p>💯 #genx #millennial #80sbaby #70sbaby #80smovies #80smusic</p>\n        </section>\n    </blockquote>\n                            <p><br /></p><p><br /></p>                <blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@amandasessions84/video/7483224696687758622\" class=\"tiktok-embed\">\n        <section>\n            <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@amandasessions84\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@amandasessions84\">@amandasessions84</a>\n            <p>#thegooniesera #thegooniesgeneration #foryoupage #fyp #goodenough #goodenoughcyndilauper #thegoonies #gooniesneversaydie☠️ #gooniesneverdie  #1984 #borninthe80s #90skid</p>\n        </section>\n    </blockquote>\n                            <p><br /></p><p><br /></p>                <blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@thatguynamedrob/video/7485018407369198879\" class=\"tiktok-embed\">\n        <section>\n            <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@thatguynamedrob\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@thatguynamedrob\">@thatguynamedrob</a>\n            <p></p>\n        </section>\n    </blockquote>\n                            <p><br /></p><p><br /></p>                <blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@michellemm50/video/7483590535090031918\" class=\"tiktok-embed\">\n        <section>\n            <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@michellemm50\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@michellemm50\">@michellemm50</a>\n            <p>Ok I’m here for this #fyp #foryou #over40 #vibes #zennial #millennial #genx #gooniesmovie</p>\n        </section>\n    </blockquote>\n                            <p><br /></p><p>\"1981, we had the best childhood out of any generation ever,\" Bugface wrote.</p><p>\"Now this is something I’m proud to be a part of!!!!!\" Rob wrote.</p><p>\"Hey you guys..\" 77 genx here, Yorkshire, England.

They are a small, compact and slightly rectangular dog, known to mature late,\" the AKC describes them, adding that they have an energetic, trainable, and attentive temperament. </p><p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/danish-swedish-farmdog/\" target=\"_blank\">AKC</a>, the average sizes and life expectancy of the Danish-Swedish Farmdog are:</p><p>Height: 12.5-14.5 inches<br />Weight: 15-20 pounds<br />Life Expectancy: 11-13 years</p><p>The Danish-Swedish Farmdog has a smooth coat, and comes in many different colors and patches, including  black, brown, yellow, all shades of tan, and fawn.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image image-crop-3x2\">        <img alt=\"danish-swedish farmdog, dog, akc \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"49ca9\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk5MDk1Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5NjM3NzIxMX0.u4WjV8jZuxq_UKZ8YbyAUcoZTH6Sbz2kPruqH1ZjK9o/img.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=800&amp;quality=50&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C440%2C0\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A group of Danish-Swedish Farmdogs.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Stigfinnare - Eget fotografi/Wikipedia</small></p>                    <p> With \"farmdog\" in its name, the Danish-Swedish Farmdog (DSF) was bred to assist in farm activities, from bringing in cows to helping with vermin control. </p><p>“A multipurpose barnyard dog, DSFs live to hunt vermin, but at home, they’re one of the easiest dogs to live with,” Aimee Parramore Kincaid, president of the <a href=\"https://dsfca.clubexpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Danish-Swedish Farmdog Club of America</a>, told the AKC. </p><p>It is a working dog that Kincaid notes can be cat-like, adding they are \"far from needy, capable of entertaining themselves,\" and also great helpers to their owners. </p><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\">\n            <div style=\"padding: 8px;\">\n                <div style=\"line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;\">\n                    <div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\">\n                    <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMYQLo2KOmV/\" style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_top\">See on Instagram</a>\n                </p>\n                \n            </div>\n        </blockquote>                    <p>While high-energy, they are social and sweet with kids. The AKC adds that they earn top marks on being affectionate with family, good with young children, and good with other dogs.</p><p>\"The best part comes when you settle down; they do, too,\" Kincaid <a href=\"https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/dog-breeds/danish-swedish-farmdog-newest-akc-recognized-breed/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. “If you like a dog sleeping with you, they’ll happily curl up under the covers and cuddle. When they’re happy to see a familiar face, they send out cute vocalizations almost like yodeling and squeaking.\"</p><p><span></span>The Danish-Swedish Farmdog also can get confused with other dog breeds. </p><p>\"People on the street or even at a dog show will stop and ask me if my DSF is a Beagle or a Jack Russell,” Kincaid told the AKC. “If they know a Jack Russell, they’ll guess Jack Russell, and if they know a Beagle, they’ll guess Beagle.”</p><p>It was once called a Danish Pinscher. “We want people to know it’s not a Terrier, but a Pinscher-type dog most likely descended from Pinscher-Fox Terrier crosses,” Kincaid added.</p>",

Or feel the rush of adrenaline as you engage in a high-speed<a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/86751/fighting-on-ice-hockey-india/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> ice hockey </a>match in the rugged beauty of Ladakh.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With their harsh winters, places like Kashmir and Ladakh transform into breathtaking winter wonderlands. These regions offer a unique canvas for sports that thrive in freezing temperatures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s dive into the rich history and thrilling future of some Indian winter sports, and experience the magic of these icy playgrounds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-ice-skating\">1. Ice skating</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The history of ice skating in Kashmir dates back to the colonial era when British officials, yearning for familiar sports from home, introduced skating to the region. During the biting cold months, when lakes like Dal freeze, the conditions become ideal for ice skating.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whether on the natural ice of Pahalgam&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/302828/best-must-take-winter-treks-in-himalayas-uttarakhand-views-adventure/\">frozen rivers</a>, or the meticulously maintained rinks of Gulmarg, the sport has found a fervent following. The best time to experience ice skating in Kashmir is from December to March when the chill in the air creates the perfect conditions for thick, stable ice.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-ice-skiing\">2. Ice skiing</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Gulmarg is renowned as one of India&rsquo;s premier skiing destinations. The origins of skiing in Gulmarg trace back to 1927, when it was established by British Army officers, Major Metcarp and Major Hadow, who founded the Ski Club of India.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During the pre-independence era, skiing in Gulmarg gained considerable popularity, with the area hosting significant skiing events during Christmas and Easter. The skiing season in Gulmarg generally begins before Christmas and continues until mid-April.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img alt=\"India provides a memorable winter sports experience set against the breathtaking backdrop of snow capped Kashmir, Ladakh and more. \" class=\"wp-image-393984\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/post_attachments/uploads/2024/12/winter-sports-india-1-1735628370.jpg\" style=\"width: 840px; height: auto;\" /><br />\n<figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">India provides a memorable winter sports experience set against the breathtaking backdrop of snow-capped Kashmir, Ladakh, and more.

Sledging</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another popular sport to try out in Gulmarg is sledging. Kongdori, particularly, is a popular destination for snow sledging, where locally handcrafted sledges enhance the experience.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other places where snow sledging can be experienced include Solang Valley in Himachal Pradesh and <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/web-stories/snow-in-india-in-march/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Auli in Uttarakhand</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-4-ice-hockey\">4. Ice hockey</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The origins of Ice hockey in Ladakh date back to the 1970s when the Ladakh Scouts Battalion, stationed in the region, innovatively crafted their hockey gear. Using makeshift equipment fashioned from army boots and rubber soles, they laid the foundation for what would become a beloved local tradition.</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"In Ladakh, ice hockey began with army boots and rubber soles. Today, it unites entire communities on frozen rinks each winter.\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/29/winter-sports-india-1735628129-2025-10-29-16-28-42.webp\" style=\"width: 1280px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>In Ladakh, ice hockey began with army boots and rubber soles. Today, it unites entire communities on frozen rinks each winter.</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Established in 1985, the Ladakh Winter Sports Club formalised the sport, organising tournaments and bringing structure to the enthusiastic community. Today, hockey is more than just a game in Ladakh; it is a spectacle that draws men, women, and children onto the ice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-5-speed-skating\">5. Speed skating</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ladakh is also known for its ice skating. A Bird Group enterprise called iSKATE in partnership with The Hockey Foundation (THF), a New York-based non-profit, operates the ice rink in the Chibra Kargyam village situated at an altitude of 14,350 feet above sea level. This 60mx30m ice rink is the <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/132697/winter-sports-ladakh-highest-ice-rink/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">&lsquo;highest&rsquo; ice rink </a>in the world. The ideal time for skating starts from late December to early February.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So, what are you waiting for? Get ready for an unforgettable adventure this winter!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Edited by Aruanava Banerjee</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
