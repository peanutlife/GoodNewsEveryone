However, these citrus trees can be a great addition to your bonsai collection. Even a small balcony can become a mini orchard with the right plants and care.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Dwarf citrus trees &mdash; lemons, limes, and oranges &mdash; are perfect for city homes, offering fresh fruits, fragrant blossoms, and the calming joy of bonsai gardening.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>People often think bonsai cultivation is expensive or time-consuming. But for those who&rsquo;ve mastered it, it&rsquo;s more an art than labour.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&ldquo;If you spend time understanding the fundamentals of nourishing a bonsai plant, you will be able to make one easily and ensure it survives for decades,&rdquo; says Mangat Singh Thakur, an 80-year-old retired banker from Rohini, Delhi, who has nurtured more than&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/270129/how-to-grow-bonsai-garden-tips-by-mangat-singh-thakur-youtube/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span>550 bonsai plants</span></a><span> on his rooftop terrace.</span></p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">A simple guide to home-grown dwarf citrus trees<b></b></h2>\n<p><strong>1.

Popular options include </span><span>Meyer Lemon, Calamondin Orange, Kagzi Lime</span><span>, and </span><span>Kinnow Mandari</span><span>. These grow compactly between 2 to 4 feet tall and thrive in medium-sized containers.</span><span><br /></span><span><br /></span><strong>2. Select the right container &amp; soil</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span></span><span>Use a pot at least 14 &ndash; 18 inches deep with drainage holes. Citrus fruits require space to grow, and they also need good drainage. The plant dislikes sitting in soggy water and may rot soon if the excess water doesn&rsquo;t escape freely.&nbsp;</span><span><br /></span><span><br /></span><span>A well-draining soil mix includes:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>1 part garden soil</span></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>1 part compost or cocopeat</span></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>1 part coarse sand or perlite</span></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Add organic manure or neem cake monthly for nourishment.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3.

Watering &amp; care</strong><span><br /></span><span><br /></span><span>Keep the soil moist but never soggy. Water only when the top inch feels dry. Check for the regular water draining capacity of the soil. If something is blocking the water drainage, take immediate action to regulate the water flow. During summer, you may need to water daily; in cooler months, reduce the frequency.</span><span><br /></span><br /><strong>5. Pruning</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Pruning is key to keeping your bonsai healthy and well-shaped. Regular pruning controls both the plant and root growth, strengthens existing roots, and ensures better fruiting. You can also wire branches once they are sturdy to guide them into the shape you want.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>When repotting from one container to another, prune the roots to prevent overcrowding and encourage a strong, compact root system. Overall, pruning is the most important step in caring for your bonsai lemon tree.</span><b></b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>6. Flowering &amp; fruiting</strong><span><br /></span><br />Feed your plant every 3 &ndash; 4 weeks during the growing season (spring to monsoon) with compost tea or a liquid citrus fertiliser.

That&rsquo;s all it takes to spark wonder.<br />Hold a chickpea in your palm &mdash; tiny, plain, and light &mdash; and it&rsquo;s hard to imagine the life waiting inside it. In a few weeks, that same seed can split open, stretch towards the sun, and grow pods filled with more seeds of its own.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For a child, this feels almost magical. Growing <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/301633/black-chickpeas-kala-chana-soup-recipe-full-of-protein-aids-healthy-weight-loss-food-science/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">chickpeas at home</a> turns an everyday seed into a living lesson in care and patience. Each stage &mdash; planting, watering, waiting &mdash; becomes a story of curiosity and discovery, where children get to watch life unfold right before their eyes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here&rsquo;s a simple, step-by-step way to help them begin this small but wonderful journey.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Select healthy seeds</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The adventure begins with selecting the seeds. Pick firm, unblemished chickpeas meant for home cultivation, as vitality is key to successful germination. Children can enjoy examining each seed &mdash; its size, shape, and texture &mdash; and even counting them carefully. This first step encourages attentiveness, anticipation, and a sense of excitement for the journey ahead.</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"grow chickpeas with kids\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/11/05/grow-chickpeas-with-kids-2025-11-05-12-40-18.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Growing chickpeas at home turns an everyday seed into a living lesson in care and patience. Photograph: <a href=\"https://www.thespruce.com/chickpea-care-guide-6456180\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(The Spruce)</a></em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Choose a sunny spot</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chickpeas thrive in well-lit and sunny spots. Whether planting in a garden bed or a large container, make sure the area receives plenty of sunlight. For containers, choose a pot at least 30 cm deep with good drainage to prevent waterlogging.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let children help choose or decorate the pots and arrange them in sunlit corners. It makes the growing space more personal and exciting&mdash;a small stage for life to unfold.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Prepare rich, well-drained soil</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Healthy soil forms the base for strong growth. Chickpeas prefer loamy, <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/418345/how-to-grow-passion-fruit-at-home-gardening-tips-step-by-step-guide-to-follow/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">well-drained soil</a> enriched with compost or well-rotted manure. Children can join in by mixing the soil and feeling its texture, learning how fertile earth sustains life. This tactile activity strengthens their connection between preparation, care, and growth.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. Soak the seeds before sowing</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before sowing, soak the seeds in water for eight to 12 hours. This softens their outer coats and helps them germinate faster. Watching the seeds swell can be fascinating for children &mdash; it&rsquo;s their first glimpse of change and a spark of curiosity about how life begins.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">5. Plant the seeds evenly</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Plant each seed gently two to three centimetres below the soil surface, spacing them about 20 centimetres apart so roots and shoots have room to grow. In containers, one seed per hole is enough.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"grow chickpeas with kids\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/11/05/grow-chickpeas-with-kids-2025-11-05-12-43-30.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Whether planting in a garden bed or a large container, make sure the area receives plenty of sunlight.

Keep the soil moist but not soaked</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chickpeas need consistent moisture, especially during germination, but too much water can harm them. Teach children how to <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/youth/young-innovators/sharanya-mehta-class-12-student-decision-support-system-irrigation-app-rural-farmers-10504004\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sprinkle water evenly</a> and check the soil&rsquo;s dampness with their fingers. This daily care builds patience, attentiveness, and a sense of responsibility &mdash; reminding them that living things thrive when cared for thoughtfully.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">7. Let the sunlight in</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sunlight is essential for chickpeas to grow well. They need at least six to eight hours of light each day.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Position containers or garden beds where they&rsquo;ll get full sun, and encourage children to observe how leaves turn towards the light. These small changes transform routine care into a fun lesson in science and the patterns of nature.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">8. Support the growing stems</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the stems grow taller, they may need support to stay upright. Simple sticks or small trellises can keep them from bending or breaking. Children can help tie the stems gently, learning how <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/446695/grow-amla-in-pots-container-gardening-indian-gooseberry-gardening-steps-grow-in-compact-spaces/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">care and gentleness protect growth</a> and strength.</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"grow chickpeas with kids\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/11/05/grow-chickpeas-with-kids-2025-11-05-12-46-56.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Children can help tie the stems gently, learning how care and gentleness protect growth. Photograph: <a href=\"https://harvesttotable.com/how_to_grow_chickpeas_garbanzo/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(Harvest to Table)</a></em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">9. Observe the growth</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Growth takes time. Encourage children to notice new shoots, emerging leaves, and delicate flowers. This stage nurtures mindfulness, curiosity, and appreciation for the slow, steady work of nature. Every observation is a reminder that patience and care always bear fruit.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">10. Harvest the results</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After about three to four months, when the pods dry and turn golden brown, it&rsquo;s time to harvest. Children can pluck the pods and open them to find the seeds inside, witnessing the tangible result of their effort. Harvesting becomes both a reward and a final lesson in the satisfaction that comes from <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/294514/german-teacher-sets-up-sustainable-dairy-farm-natural-farming-earns-lakhs/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">care and consistency</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Growing chickpeas may start as a small home project, but for children, it often becomes something much deeper &mdash; a story of life unfolding in their own hands.</p>",

      "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91429737/what-failure-taught-me-about-entrepreneurship-fauilure-entrepreneurship",
      "summary": "<p>Over the past 50 years in the shoe trade, I have had my fair share of failure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest lesson I learned, at the start of my career, is not to devote time and energy to a business or project that has little chance of success. This might sound obvious, however sometimes you are so involved in the detail of the day to day running of the business that you don’t stand back and question the future viability of what you are doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was a women’s shoe manufacturer in London in the 1980s. If I had looked at the big picture I would have seen that the future of manufacturing in the U.K. for low technology, high labor content businesses like footwear manufacturing, was unsustainable. Most of the production was moving to Asia where costs were much lower and the quality was excellent. It took a visit to Taiwan to see the same shoes being made at half the price that it was costing us in our London factory to persuade me to leave manufacturing and become an importer. My lesson is to respond quickly and try and anticipate change.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pressure-on-middlemen\">Pressure on middlemen</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another example is from the 2000s. I was a successful importer from Asia, a business I set up in 1986 called Browning Enterprises. It had a turnover of £60m. As communications improved and markets opened, more Chinese manufacturers and trading companies came directly to the major U.K. retailers, putting pressure on the margins of the middlemen, like me. Our costs were too high. We couldn’t compete. The import company struggled on till 2009.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the decline in the importing business and the desire to start my own brand that led to me to launch Dune in 1992.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-temper-your-optimism\">Temper your optimism</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another failure was opening unprofitable stores. This is an expensive mistake as the £400k investment is written off when the store is closed. The failure is usually due to overestimating the level of sales. The costs of a new store are easily calculated. The big variable, that is largely a matter of judgement, is the sales number. Of course you do your due diligence by looking at footfall figures, studying demographics, and talking to adjacent stores to try and judge their performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, you come to a sales number. The lesson is to be cautious about the level of sales. Look carefully at the possible downsides. As an entrepreneur your natural tendency is to be optimistic. You must temper this optimism. Resist the temptation to open the shop because you want to grow. It has got to make commercial sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an entrepreneur it is easy to get distracted and sidetracked into ventures that are not related to your area of expertise. This loss of focus can be damaging, as not only is there a high probability that the new venture is unprofitable and you will lose money, but it also takes your attention away from your main activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-not-special\">Not special</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My career has been in fashion footwear. That’s what I know. However, during the pandemic, I launched a sustainable trainer brand. I felt that was where the growth was in footwear, so that’s where I needed to be.&nbsp; It was a failure. Why? Two reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, it wasn’t special enough. It was a good, well-made sustainable product but in a crowded market it didn’t have an important point of difference that would make it stand out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, we didn’t go out and aggressively sell the product. I thought I would generate the online sales through the website. This was a mistake. We needed to sell wholesale as well, not only to generate sales but to get the brand out there in the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two important lessons for entrepreneurs here. One: Don’t underestimate the <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/marketing\" title=\"Marketing\">marketing</a> cost of selling a new brand online. Two: You may have a great product, but it is essential that you get out there and sell. It is no coincidence that over the years the sales team has been the highest earners in the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-avoid-distraction\">Avoid distraction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We launched a range of children’s shoes. This was related to our main activity, but as we found to our cost, the market is very different from adult’s shoes. As we didn’t have the space in our stores to offer the range we focussed on online and wholesale. Selling a new brand of children’s shoes online was more difficult than we anticipated. Mothers like to buy their kids’ shoes in a physical store. In addition, the market was polarized between the established heritage brands, Clarks and Startrite, and the large stores like Next, Marks &amp; Spencer, and Zara, who were offering similar shoes at lower prices. The lesson is clear. Resist the temptation to get distracted unless you are very confident that the new venture is financially compelling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-right-team\">The right team</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, having the right team in place is essential. As an entrepreneur there is a danger that you are reluctant to give up control. It is essential to recognize the limitations of your abilities and <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/hiring\" title=\"Hiring\">hire</a> a team that can do things better than you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The importance of building the right team came into sharp focus in 2009 when we acquired a company called Shoe Studio and trebled our size. A year after the acquisition we started to struggle. Our profits fell. We didn’t have the management expertise to run a larger business. My skills and time were being stretched to the limit. We employed a first-class FD and a team of senior experienced retailers which transformed the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a well-known expression that you learn more from your failures than your successes. That is certainly my experience. And if the project is failing, then fail fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

To capitalize on that trend—and give candy canes a run for their money—Hershey’s new peppermint Kit Kat bars come in three sizes to appease all hunger magnitudes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the classic Hershey’s Milk Chocolate Bars are continuing their partnership with the Grinch, Dr. Seuss&#8217;s iconic Christmas hater. Popular characters such as Cindy Lou Who, Max, and the big-hearted green guy himself are featured on the packaging and in the design of the chocolate for a fun, festive treat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whimsical shapes are also here to stay. Reese’s Peanut Butter Trees, now available in a mini version, are a perfect tree-trimming snack.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-hershey-became-a-confectionary-powerhouse\">How Hershey became a confectionary powerhouse</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These days, the name Hershey is synonymous with chocolate bars, but the company actually started with caramel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1886, Milton S. Hershey founded the Lancaster Caramel Co. in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Hershey got the idea to make chocolate while attending the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/money/Hershey-Chocolate-Corporation\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">World’s Columbian Exposition</a> in Chicago in 1893, and wasted no time launching the Hershey Chocolate Co. as a subsidiary of his original business the following year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1900, he sold Lancaster Caramel but retained the chocolate side of the business. That same year, Hershey started selling milk chocolate bars. Chocolate Kisses made their debut seven years later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1925, the Goodbar was introduced, and in 1963 Hershey acquired H.B. Reese Candy Co.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today Hershey is the parent company for more than 100 brands, including Jolly Rancher, Rolos, and SkinnyPop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a market cap of roughly $34 billion, the company reported net sales of $11.2 billion last year. And it&#8217;s not just about sweet treats. Hershey’s salty snacks unit in North America <a href=\"https://hershey.gcs-web.com/static-files/227fb818-6d03-4675-ae48-e5bd4cfe8014\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">grew 10%</a> in the third quarter of this year, generating $321 million.</p>\n\n\n<hr />",

It also includes a thread and a sewing machine in reference to the traditional concentration of sewing, fabric, and haberdashery businesses on this street.

The triumph lies not in picking the produce, but in knowing how to preserve it, so its flavours and vitality survive through winter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With practical methods that combine time-honoured wisdom and easy household solutions, you can turn your fall harvest into a pantry treasure trove. This guide will walk you through the nuances of harvesting and storing your garden&rsquo;s bounty:</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Knowing when to harvest</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Harvesting at the right moment is essential. Crops left in the soil too long risk losing freshness and flavour, while picking too early may mean sacrificing quality and storability.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">For root vegetables like carrots, radishes and sweet potatoes, observe their shoulders protruding slightly above the soil; they should feel firm and well-developed.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/259690/how-to-home-garden-aurangabad-organic-vegetables-facebook/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Leafy greens</a> should be picked when leaves have reached full size but remain tender and bright.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fruits such as guavas, pomegranates, and other fall crops are ripe when their skin is dark-coloured, firm, and gives slightly under gentle pressure.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"harvesting and storing autumn crops\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/harvesting-and-storing-autumn-crops-2025-10-28-22-01-12.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Fruits such as guavas, pomegranates, and other fall crops are ripe when their skin is dark-coloured and can be harvested.

Dry conditions at harvest reduce moisture that could otherwise invite premature spoilage or mould growth.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Gentle harvesting preserves freshness</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The way you handle your produce post-harvest influences its shelf life. Bruises or cuts create entry points for decay.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Use sharp, clean tools such as garden knives or scissors to cut produce cleanly from the plant.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Avoid washing freshly harvested crops immediately; instead, gently brush away any soil. Washing can add unwelcome moisture, encouraging rot.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Place vegetables and fruits in shallow trays or baskets, avoiding heaping them into piles that could crush delicate produce.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Taking a little extra care now pays dividends in preserving quality for weeks or even months to come.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Creating the perfect storage environment at home</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many gardeners believe refrigeration is necessary for storing harvests, but with the right conditions, many crops can be kept fresh without it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Select a cool, dark, and dry space, such as a cellar, storeroom, or a shaded balcony, that remains well ventilated. Temperatures between 10&deg;C and 15&deg;C are ideal.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Root vegetables, such as potatoes, <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/250476/kerala-wayanad-organic-farmer-c-v-verghese-terrace-gardening-how-to-grow-organic-vegetables-vertical-mesh-tower-method-ros174/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">carrots, and sweet potatoes</a>, keep best when stored in boxes or crates layered with dry sand or sawdust. This helps maintain moisture balance, keeping them firm and crisp.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Leafy greens have a shorter lifespan but can be preserved by wrapping loosely in a damp muslin cloth and storing in the coolest part of the house or refrigerator for short-term use.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"harvesting and storing autumn crops\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/harvesting-and-storing-autumn-crops-2025-10-28-22-04-36.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Root vegetables, such as potatoes, carrots, and sweet potatoes, keep best when stored in boxes.

Traditional storage techniques for gardeners</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many time-tested methods from rural traditions remain invaluable for today&rsquo;s gardeners:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Evaporative cooling chambers, crafted from two nested clay pots with moist sand in between, create a natural cooling effect that prolongs freshness.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hanging dried vegetables and fruits in breathable cloth bags keeps produce away from pests and encourages airflow, preventing mould.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Storing pulses, grains and dried goods in earthenware pots lined with neem leaves acts as a natural insect repellent and maintains dryness.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These low-cost techniques can be replicated at home with materials readily available in most households.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Preparing crops for long-term storage</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Proper preparation is essential for extending shelf life:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Curing tubers like sweet potatoes involves keeping them in a warm, dry, airy place for several days.

Traditional irrigation methods often lead to significant water wastage, affecting both crop health and the environment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/415378/parmeshwar-thorat-avocado-farming-drought-prone-beed-steps-to-follow/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Drip irrigation presents a smart solution</a>, a way to deliver water straight to the roots, conserving every drop and boosting crop productivity. Whether you are growing vegetables, fruits, or other crops, learning to install a drip irrigation system can change the way you farm, making your operation more efficient and sustainable.</p>\n<p>Here is a step-by-step guide to get you started.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-step-1-analyse-your-farm-s-water-needs-and-layout\">Step 1: Analyse your farm&rsquo;s water needs and layout</h2>\n<p>Begin by carefully examining your farm. Measure the size of your fields and note the types of crops you are growing. Each crop has different water requirements depending on its growth stage and the soil it grows in.</p>\n<p>Understanding these details will help you design a system that supplies just the right amount of water, avoiding both wastage and underwatering.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-step-2-select-the-right-drip-irrigation-equipment\">Step 2: Select the right drip irrigation equipment</h2>\n<p>Next, gather your materials. You will need a reliable water source, a pump if the water pressure is low, a filtration unit to keep the system clear of debris, pressure regulators to maintain steady flow, main pipes, lateral drip tubes fitted with emitters, and valves to <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/350000/how-to-grow-avocado-in-india-urban-farmer-harshit-godha-imports-saplings-from-israel-teaches-farming/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">control water distribution</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Choosing quality components suited to your farm&rsquo;s size will guarantee the system lasts and performs well.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-step-3-lay-down-your-main-pipes-and-branch-lines\">Step 3: Lay down your main pipes and branch lines</h2>\n<p>Begin by laying the main pipeline from your water source along a convenient path through or around your farm. From this line, extend sub-main pipes to cover all areas of your fields.</p>\n<p>Ensure all joints and connections are firmly secured to prevent leaks and maintain efficiency.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Ensure all joints and connections are firmly secured to prevent leaks and maintain efficiency.\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/09/12/featured-img-9-2025-09-12-13-02-10.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Ensure all joints and connections are firmly secured to prevent leaks and maintain efficiency.</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-step-4-attach-drip-lines-and-position-emitters-correctly\">Step 4: Attach drip lines and position emitters correctly</h2>\n<p>Connect the lateral drip lines to your sub-main pipes and run them alongside your crop rows. Emitters, the tiny devices that release water drop by drop, should be spaced carefully according to your crop spacing and soil type.</p>\n<p>This precise water delivery makes sure that <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/443287/grow-brinjal-at-home-monsoon-guide-growing-in-pots-small-space-step-by-step-guide-gardening-tips/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">moisture reaches the roots without wastage</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-step-5-install-filtration-and-pressure-regulation-systems\">Step 5: Install filtration and pressure regulation systems</h2>\n<p>Before water enters the main pipes, fit a filtration system to remove any dirt or particles that might clog your drip emitters.</p>\n<p>Pressure regulators are equally important to keep the water flowing evenly through the system, protecting your pipes and emitters from damage due to pressure fluctuations.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-step-6-conduct-a-thorough-system-test\">Step 6: Conduct a thorough system test</h2>\n<p>Turn on the system and observe the flow through each emitter. Look out for leaks, blockages, or uneven water distribution. Testing allows you to make any necessary adjustments early, making sure your crops receive consistent moisture once the system is fully operational.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"To maintain the drip irrigation system function smoothly, clean the filters often and flush the pipes to remove any sediment build-up; Picture source: Mahavir Water Tanks \" class=\"wp-image-494779\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/post_attachments/uploads/2025/09/Blue-and-Yellow-Modern-Business-Workshop-Facebook-Ad-2025-09-01T182243.167_11zon-1756731181.jpg\" /><br />\n<figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>To maintain the drip irrigation system function smoothly, clean the filters often and flush the pipes to remove any sediment build-up; <a href=\"https://mahavirgroup.org/mini-irrigation-drip-irrigation/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Picture source: Mahavir Water Tanks </a></em></figcaption>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-step-7-maintain-your-drip-irrigation-system-regularly\">Step 7: Maintain your drip irrigation system regularly</h2>\n<p>To keep your system running smoothly, <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/440535/rainwater-harvesting-guide-simple-monsoon-conservation/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">clean the filters often</a> and flush the pipes to remove any sediment build-up. Regular checks for leaks or damage will help maintain efficiency. Keep an eye on your crops&rsquo; health and soil moisture to fine-tune irrigation schedules over time.</p>\n<p>A well-installed drip irrigation system does more than just save water; it boosts crop yields, improves plant health, and reduces labour by automating daily watering tasks. This investment in smart farming technology can lead to a more prosperous and sustainable future for your farm.</p>",

Then, in 1848, the women's rights movement in the United States began with a powerful second wave coming in the 1960s and 70s, empowering women in the workplace, ushering in the era of two working parents, and producing an entire generation of <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/17-gen-x-memes-ex1\" target=\"_self\">\"latchkey kids.\"</a></p><p>Now those <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/tag/gen-x\" target=\"_self\">Gen X</a> latchkey kids are parenting Gen Z, with the pendulum of <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/working-moms-applaud-scientists-for-honest-photo-of-cnn-interview\" target=\"_self\">working motherhood</a> having swung somewhat to the middle. We were raised to believe we could be anything we dreamed of being and that we didn't have to choose between being a mom and having a career. Gen X also became mothers during the heyday of <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Generation_Next_Parenting.html?id=2H4-af3OqcYC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">parenting self-help books</a> that impressed upon us the importance of attachment and hands-on childrearing, as well as the era of super-scheduled kids, <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/mom-rants-about-sports\" target=\"_self\">whose activities alone require a full-time manager.</a></p><p>As a result, those of us in our 40s have raised our kids straddling two worlds—one where women can have all of the career success we desire and one where we can choose to be stay-at-home moms who run seemingly effortless households. </p><p>At first, we were told we could have it all, but when the impossibility of that became clear, we were told, \"Well, you <em>can</em> have it all, just not at the same time.\" But as many moms are finding as their kids start leaving the nest, even that isn't the full truth.</p><p><strong>In 2023, a Facebook post by Karen Johnson, aka The 21st Century SAHM (short for \"stay-at-home mom\") nailed the reality many stay-at-home moms in their 40s are facing as they find themselves floundering with the glaring gap in their resumes.</strong></p><p>\"This is for all the moms in their 40s who put their careers on hold to do the SAHM thing because you knew you couldn't do both—career you loved and motherhood—and do both WELL, so you picked, saying to yourself, 'This is just for now and we'll see,'\" Johnson wrote. \"But now it's 15 years later and so much has changed in your career field that you know you can't go back. So really, when you 'took a break' all those years ago, you gave it up.\"</p><div class=\"rm-shortcode\"><div class=\"fb-post\"></div></div><p>Johnson explained that yes, moms know they should be grateful for the time they've had with their kids. Most are. That's not the issue. Whether a woman chose to be a stay-at-home mom because she really wanted to or because childcare costs didn't work in the financial equation of the family, the transition out of it feels like completely uncharted waters.</p><p>\"Okay, so you're looking for a 'career' with part-time hours and a 100% flexible schedule because you're still Mom-on-duty but you do have *just* enough hours during the day to reflect on the fact that you *do* have a college degree (maybe even 2) and although being a mom is the greatest and most important job in the world, you *might* actually want something more to your life than folding laundry and running hangry children to 900 events and remembering that they're all due for dental cleanings,\" she wrote.</p><p>Yup. The <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/default-parent\" target=\"_self\">\"default parent\" role</a> is real and weighted <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/default-parent-doorbell-video-ex1\" target=\"_self\">heavily toward moms</a> as it is. For stay-at-home moms, it's 100% expected, and that doesn't suddenly end when it's time to start thinking about joining the workforce again.</p><h3>And, of course, moms barely have time to try to figure all of this out.</h3><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">- YouTube</small>        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">                <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHFYS1Qj0b0\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com</a>        </small>        </p><p>So, as Johnson says, \"But for now, you cram yourself into the only pair of jeans you have right now that fit and find a t-shirt on the floor that isn't clean but isn't dirty and will pass for the 4 hours of mom-taxiing you're about to do and you tell yourself, 'I'll figure it out another day. Right now, I gotta get the kids to practice.'\" Oof.</p><p>Johnson's <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/21stcenturysahm/posts/pfbid0jVmhv5rdu55VFEUUfyjDp7L6JxNKaai5PF3Hcm6CYGkH5KsnLmy56nizB9eD2rzpl\" target=\"_blank\">entire post </a>is worth a read, as it resonates with so many women at this stage of life. But just as telling are the comments from women who not only see themselves in Johnson's description but who feel like they were sold a bill of goods early in their motherhood. So many of us were led to believe that the skills and experiences of managing a family would be valued in the workplace simply because they should be and that the gap in their resume wouldn't matter.</p><p>\"This hits hard.

It’s insane but every term I complete I’m like - omg I’m doing it! So don’t let sweaty out of shape bodies and carpool fatigue stop you. I take naps and write grad school papers and have meltdowns where I cry from the frustration of it all - but dammit I’m doing it!\" wrote another.</p><p>One mom who is past this stage also offered some words of encouragement:</p><p>\"So incredibly well written. I feel all these things and did throughout my 40s. Now I'm in my early '50s and I'm so glad I was able to stay home with my kids, but the guilt! The guilt of not using my education, the judgment of people who don't understand why someone would stay home with their kids, the social engineering... We just eat each other alive sometimes don't we? I wouldn't trade it for anything, but it is a very lonely road and one you always question. I can tell you that all three of my kids were so grateful to have a full-time parent. I might not have always been the best, but they were glad to always have someone to talk to if they needed it. It's hard to fill other people's buckets when your bucket isn't full, but the rewards do come back when the kids tell you thank you for everything that you've done. <img alt=\"❤️\" src=\"https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t6c/1/16/2764.png\" />\"</p><p>Being a mom is hard, period. Working moms have it hard, stay-at-home moms have it hard, moms who have managed to keep one foot in the career door and one foot in the home have it hard. There's a lot that society could do to support moms more no matter what path they choose (or find themselves on—it's not always a conscious choice), from providing paid maternity leave to greater flexibility with work schedules to retirement plans that account for time away from the workplace. Perhaps that would at least make the many choices moms have today feel more like freedom and less like choosing between a rock and a hard place.</p><p><em>This article originally appeared two years ago.

      "link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91433493/forget-skincare-and-tequila-novak-djokovic-just-joined-the-celebrity-popcorn-boom",
      "summary": "<p>This weekend, tennis star Novak Djokovic is serving snackers something a little different: a new sorghum-based, corn-free “popcorn” brand called Cob, which will compete in the same aisle as SkinnyPop and Orville Redenbacher’s. The popcorn’s launch coincides with the announcement of a $5 million seed round for the startup that’s led by Djokovic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Popcorn has become a particularly alluring category for celebrities over the past few years. New entrants have included Khloud Protein Popcorn backed by reality TV star Khloé Kardashian; singer Luke Bryan’s Boldly Grown Popcorn; and Rob’s BackStage Popcorn, cofounded by the pop rock band the Jonas Brothers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-popcorn\">Why popcorn?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What they are nibbling on is a growing market that’s welcoming to new brands that promote bolder flavors, avoid canola oil and artificial butter flavors and colors, and include claims of higher protein or low-carb formulations. The U.S. popcorn market grew by 31% to $3.5 billion over a five-year period through 2024, according to market researcher Mintel, and is forecasted to be valued at $3.84 billion by 2029.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I wanted to join the brand as cofounder, as well as lead the seed round, to give other investors confidence in our vision,” says Djokovic in an emailed statement.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91433573\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/11/i-2-91433493-novak-djokovic-celebrity-popcorn-boom.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: Cob]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cob is a gluten-free snack that’s made from the grain sorghum, which is naturally rich in fiber, iron, and plant-based protein. The brand was originally conceptualized and created by entrepreneur Jessica Davidoff, who was inspired to explore snacking alternatives that could be served to her son, who suffers from an allergy to corn. “My eyes were open to just how vast corn was in the American food system,” Davidoff tells <em>Fast Company</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That led her to visit a local grocery store in New York that promoted international ingredients and start testing snacks that could be made in the kitchen that were similar to popcorn, but without the key base ingredient. Davidoff felt that sorghum delivered the best taste from all the alternatives she tested. “It offers this new option for people who really like popcorn but want to take the nutrition component up a notch,” she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cob will be sold direct-to-consumer through online channels including the brand’s website, at a price of $59.99 for a 24-pack of 1-ounce single-serve snack packs. The initial launch features four flavors, including Mediterranean herb, and olive oil and pink salt. Davidoff says the brand intends to launch more sorghum-based products in the future. Djokovic will serve as an adviser on ingredients, formulations, and product line extensions, as well as support <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/marketing\" title=\"Marketing\">marketing</a> and future brand collaborations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-growing-trend\">A growing trend</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Healthier popcorn brands began to emerge as a force in the category after SkinnyPop launched in 2010. The brand’s pitch was that it featured only three ingredients: popcorn, sunflower oil, and salt. This streamlined ingredient list resonated with snackers, and sales quickly soared. The brand’s parent company, Amplify, was later <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/18/hershey-in-1-point-6-billion-deal-to-acquire-skinnypop-parent-amplify.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">acquired</a> by candymaker Hershey for $1.6 billion in 2017.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, newer popcorn brands have promoted their use of coconut, olive, and avocado oils and have avoided artificially added butters, which are most associated with the microwavable brands. “For people who really like to snack, popcorn is only 30 calories per cup,” says New York-based dietitian Samantha Cassetty, noting that the calorie count is less than what’s found in most other crunchy snacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brands like Cob have also promoted their alignment with GLP-1, one of the buzziest new trends in food as consumers increasingly embrace GLP-1 weight-loss medications like Ozempic and Wegovy. Cob says that sorghum is a resistant starch, meaning it can naturally boost a body’s GLP-1 to make a snacker feel fuller for longer. “All of the CPG [consumer packaged goods] companies are looking for ways to target that consumer who is snacking less,” Cassetty says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kardashian’s Khloud voraciously promotes the nutritional claim of 7 grams of protein per serving that’s from a blend of milk protein isolate. The popcorn brand was created to tap into three big trends: Protein snacks are growing three times faster than the market, “protein” is the most trending ingredient among millennial and Gen Z consumers, and popcorn is the fastest-growing salty snack category, according to Khloud CEO Jeff Rubenstein.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91433576\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/11/i-1-91433493-novak-djokovic-celebrity-popcorn-boom.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Photo: Khloud]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, protein-packed foods tended to come in the form of bars and shakes, frequently promoted to gym-obsessed men, Rubenstein says. “We can do this more femininely,” he says, noting the brand features more vibrant packaging that includes soft pink and blue. “We can attract a different audience to protein.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brand <a href=\"https://people.com/khloe-kardashian-launches-khloud-protein-popcorn-11719141\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">debuted in April</a> with a 60-day retail exclusive at Target, and by January will be sold in more than 25,000 retail stores including Kroger and Walmart. Rubenstein says Khloud has an authentic founder story with Kardashian: “She had an entire closet in her house that was dedicated to just snacks. She made Khloud a functional snack that is fashionable.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Djokovic was drawn to the popcorn category because while he prefers home-cooked meals with simple ingredients, the pro athlete travels a lot with a very hectic schedule. “At Cob, we’re creating packaged foods with the same ingredients and recipes we’d use in our own kitchens to allow people to eat well even when they’re away from their kitchens,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Celebrities have craved snacks as an investment opportunity because similar to the beauty category, they can sell high volumes and drive more steady, repeatable purchasing patterns than apparel or jewelry. Snacks can also generate gross profit margins of 40% for manufacturers, according to Alex Kushnir, a real and consumer partner at consultancy Baringa, who notes, “It happens to be one of the more profitable categories in food.”</p>\n\n\n<hr />",

Conversely, a rapid decline in active listings could suggest a market that’s heating up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the national Pandemic Housing Boom fizzled out in 2022, the national power dynamic has slowly been shifting directionally from sellers to buyers.

This indicates that homebuyers have gained some leverage in many parts of the country over the past year. Some seller’s markets have turned into balanced markets, and more balanced markets have turned into buyer’s markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nationally, we’re still below pre-pandemic 2019 inventory levels (9% below October 2019) and some resale markets, in particular chunks of the Midwest and Northeast, still remain tight-ish.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91433482\" height=\"930\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/11/activeusinventoryforsale.png\" width=\"1024\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While national active inventory is still up year over year, the pace of growth has slowed in recent months—more than typical seasonality would suggest—as some sellers have thrown in the towel and delisted in weak/soft markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>October inventory/active listings* total, according to </em><a href=\"https://realtor.com/?utm_source=www.resiclubanalytics.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=17-states-are-back-above-pre-pandemic-2019-housing-inventory-levels\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Realtor.com</em></a><em>:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>October 2017 -&gt; 1,287,322 📉</li>\n\n\n\n<li>October 2018 -&gt; 1,304,682 📈</li>\n\n\n\n<li>October 2019 -&gt; 1,208,311 📉</li>\n\n\n\n<li>October 2020 -&gt; 734,040 📉</li>\n\n\n\n<li>October 2021 -&gt; 565,707 📉 (overheating during the Pandemic Housing Boom)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>October 2022 -&gt; 752,741 📈</li>\n\n\n\n<li>October 2023 -&gt; 738,082 📉</li>\n\n\n\n<li>October 2024 -&gt; 953,814 📈</li>\n\n\n\n<li>October 2025 -&gt; 1,100,001 📈</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If we maintain the current year-over-year pace of inventory growth (+146,187 homes for sale), we&#8217;d have 1,246,188 active inventory come October 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below is the year-over-year active inventory percentage change by state.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>While active housing inventory is rising in most markets on a year-over-year basis, some markets still remain tight-ish (although it&#8217;s loosening in those places too).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <em>ResiClub</em> has been documenting, both active resale and new homes for sale remain the most limited across huge swaths of the Midwest and Northeast. That’s where home sellers next spring are likely to have more power, relatively speaking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, active housing inventory for sale has neared or surpassed pre-pandemic 2019 levels in many parts of the Sunbelt and Mountain West, including metro-area housing markets such as Punta Gorda, Florida, and Austin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of these areas saw major price surges during the Pandemic Housing Boom, with home prices getting stretched compared to local incomes. As pandemic-driven domestic migration slowed and mortgage rates rose, markets like Tampa and Austin faced challenges, relying on local income levels to support frothy home prices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This softening trend was accelerated further by an abundance of new home supply in the Sunbelt. Builders are often willing to lower prices or offer affordability incentives (if they have the margins to do so) to maintain sales in a shifted market, which also has a cooling effect on the resale market: Some buyers who would have previously considered existing homes are now opting for new homes with more favorable deals. That puts additional upward pressure on resale inventory.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of October 2025, 17 states were above pre-pandemic 2019 active inventory levels: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Washington. (The District of Columbia—which we left out of this analysis—is also back above pre-pandemic 2019 active inventory levels. <a href=\"https://x.com/NewsLambert/status/1895943456289407415?utm_source=www.resiclubanalytics.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=17-states-are-back-above-pre-pandemic-2019-housing-inventory-levels\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Softness in D.C. proper</a> predates the current admin’s job cuts.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Big picture: Over the past few years we’ve observed a softening across many housing markets as strained affordability tempers the fervor of a market that was unsustainably hot during the Pandemic Housing Boom. While <a href=\"https://www.resiclubanalytics.com/p/monthly-housing-market-home-price-analysis-spanning-over-800-metros-and-3-000-counties-june-2025\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">home prices are falling some in pockets of the Sunbelt</a>, a big chunk of Northeast and Midwest markets still eked out a little price appreciation this spring. Nationally aggregated home prices have been pretty close to flat in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91433486\" height=\"1221\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/11/activehousingoctober2025.png\" width=\"1024\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Below is another version of the table above—but this one includes every month since January 2017.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr />",

This transitional period, characterised by cooler days and moderate humidity, creates ideal conditions for off-season farming.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For small-scale farmers, it presents a valuable opportunity to grow high-demand vegetables that command premium prices, while maximising land use and building a steady source of income.</p>\n<h2>Best vegetables to cultivate in autumn</h2>\n<h3>1. Spinach</h3>\n<p>Spinach is a nutrient-dense leafy vegetable that flourishes in the cool and moist conditions of autumn. Its rapid growth cycle of approximately 25 to 30 days means it can provide a quick return and multiple harvests in one season. Rich in iron and vitamins, it enjoys year-round demand in both households and markets.</p>\n<p><strong>How to grow:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prepare well-drained, fertile soil enriched with organic compost to retain moisture yet avoid waterlogging.</li>\n<li>Sow seeds thinly at about one centimetre depth directly into the soil beds.</li>\n<li>Water regularly every two to three days, making sure the soil remains moist but not soggy.</li>\n<li>Once seedlings reach a few centimetres in height, thin them to allow five to seven centimetres spacing for healthy leaf development.</li>\n<li>Harvest outer leaves carefully to encourage continuous regrowth, allowing multiple pickings over several weeks.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Off-season farming\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/off-season-farming-2025-10-28-14-15-34.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Spinach is a nutrient-dense leafy vegetable that flourishes in the cool conditions.

Fenugreek</h3>\n<p>Fenugreek, valued both as a <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/259690/how-to-home-garden-aurangabad-organic-vegetables-facebook/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">leafy vegetable</a> and for its medicinal qualities, prospers in autumn&rsquo;s moderate temperatures. It grows rapidly and requires minimal inputs, making it ideal for small farmers. Its distinctive aroma and flavour make it a staple in many kitchens.</p>\n<p><strong>How to grow:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Broadcast seeds evenly over well-tilled soil and lightly cover with a thin layer of earth.</li>\n<li>Maintain consistent moisture by watering gently every alternate day.</li>\n<li>Germination usually occurs within seven days.</li>\n<li>Cut the leaves about two centimetres above the base after 20 to 25 days to allow for regrowth and multiple harvests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. Radish</h3>\n<p>Radish is a fast-growing root vegetable that matures within 30 to 40 days, surviving in the cool and gentle conditions of autumn. Its crisp texture and peppery flavour make it a favourite, while its quick turnaround makes it a profitable choice.</p>\n<p><strong>How to grow:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Select loose, sandy or loamy soil to facilitate unrestricted root growth.</li>\n<li>Sow seeds directly in shallow rows, about one centimetre deep, spacing seeds two to three centimetres apart.</li>\n<li>Once seedlings sprout, thin them to five centimetres spacing to allow room for bulb development.</li>\n<li>Keep soil moist consistently, avoiding waterlogging to prevent rot.</li>\n<li>Harvest roots when they are tender and firm, before they become woody and overly pungent.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4. Carrot</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/496839/punjab-farmer-phuman-singh-carrot-farming-earns-crores/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Carrots, prized for their sweetness</a> and crunch, perform exceptionally well in autumn&rsquo;s cooler climate, which enhances their flavour.

Coriander</h3>\n<p>Coriander is a fragrant herb essential to many culinary traditions and grows swiftly during autumn. Both the fresh leaves and seeds are valued, providing dual harvest potential.</p>\n<p><strong>How to grow:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lightly crush seeds before sowing to improve germination rates.</li>\n<li>Sow thinly in well-drained soil beds and cover seeds lightly.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/477793/self-watering-planter-osmos-gowtham-reddy-hyderabad/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Water gently every day</a> or two to keep the soil moist.</li>\n<li>Thin seedlings to five centimetres apart to avoid overcrowding.</li>\n<li>Leaves can be harvested within three to four weeks; allow some plants to flower and produce seeds for a later harvest.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>6. Cauliflower</h3>\n<p>Cauliflower is a cool-season crop that develops best in autumn when temperatures are mild. It is prized for its firm, white curds and commands premium prices, particularly during off-season periods.</p>\n<p><strong>How to grow:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start seedlings in a nursery for three to four weeks to certify strong and healthy plants.</li>\n<li>Prepare raised beds with fertile, well-draining soil and transplant seedlings at 45 to 60 cm spacing.</li>\n<li>Provide ample sunlight and maintain consistent moisture with regular watering.</li>\n<li>Apply organic fertilisers, such as well-rotted manure or compost tea, to encourage robust growth.</li>\n<li>Protect developing curds from harsh sunlight by loosely tying outer leaves over the heads if needed to prevent yellowing.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Off-season farming\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/off-season-farming-2025-10-28-14-25-59.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Cauliflower is a cool-season crop that develops best in autumn.

In this ancient dialogue between Lord Krishna and Yudhishthira, Krishna emphasizes that desires, when pursued mindfully and in alignment with one's duties, can lead to a fulfilled and harmonious life.

These seasonal crops, such as <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/465233/zabo-apatani-water-farming-northeast-india/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rice, maize, millets, pulses</a>, and cotton, are the result of months of hard work.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, the final phase of the farming cycle, the harvest, can be just as critical as the sowing itself. Mistakes made during this stage can reduce both yield and quality, leading to lower market prices and greater waste.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fortunately, with a few well-timed actions and simple precautions, farmers can make sure their harvest reaches its full potential. The following tips are designed to help farmers make the most of the harvest season, protect their crops, and reduce unnecessary losses.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Harvest at the right stage of maturity</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Harvesting too early or too late can lead to grain loss, spoilage, or poor-quality produce. Here is when to harvest some common kharif crops:</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Rice: When around 80-85% of the grains have turned golden.</li>\n<li>Maize: When the husks are dry and the kernels are firm.</li>\n<li>Pulses: When most pods are dry and brittle.</li>\n<li>Cotton: When the bolls are fully open and dry, avoid picking damp bolls.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Harvesting kharif crops\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/27/harvesting-kharif-crops-2025-10-27-18-09-58.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Using the correct tools makes the harvesting process smoother and more efficient Photograph: </em><a href=\"https://www.agrifarming.in/kharif-and-rabi-crops-in-india-a-full-guide\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>(Agri Farming)</em></a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Watch your field closely during the final weeks. If in doubt, test-harvest a small patch and examine the grain or pod condition.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Use the right tools and equipment</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Using the correct tools <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/sustainability/sohan-naik-power-planet-solar-energy-startup-powering-rural-karnataka-communities-10516336\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">makes the harvesting process smoother</a> and more efficient. A sharp sickle or well-maintained harvesting tool can reduce damage to the crop and lower the risk of grain shattering or spillage. For larger farms or crops like paddy and maize, mechanised options such as combine harvesters can save time and significantly reduce labour costs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Regardless of the method, it is important to avoid using worn or blunt tools, as they tend to damage plants and increase the chance of post-harvest losses.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Avoid leaving crops on damp ground</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After cutting, harvested crops should never be left directly on wet or muddy ground. Moisture at this stage can quickly lead to fungal growth, rotting, or contamination. Instead, place harvested produce on clean mats, tarpaulins, or raised platforms to keep them dry and safe.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If there is any risk of unexpected rainfall, cover the crops with breathable materials such as jute or straw. Keeping the produce dry during this stage is essential for maintaining quality.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. Dry the crop properly before storage</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moisture is one of the main causes of <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/467095/solar-dryer-based-business/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">post-harvest spoilage</a>. Once the crops are gathered, they must be dried thoroughly before they are stored. Sun-drying is the most accessible method. Spread the grains in thin layers on clean surfaces and turn them regularly to allow even drying.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For most grains, a moisture content of around 12 to 14 per cent is ideal for safe storage. Drying directly on bare earth should be avoided, as it can introduce dust, stones, and other impurities into the crop.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Harvesting kharif crops\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/27/harvesting-kharif-crops-2025-10-27-18-16-48.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Moisture is one of the main causes of post-harvest spoilage Photograph: <a href=\"https://www.cropin.com/blogs/kharif-crop/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(Cropin)</a></em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">5. Store in clean and ventilated spaces</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once drying is complete, storage becomes the next priority. Use clean, dry, and well-ventilated spaces to keep the harvest safe. Bags of grain should be stacked on wooden pallets or raised platforms to prevent direct contact with the floor, which often retains moisture. You can use gunny bags or jute sacks, as they allow air to circulate while keeping the produce contained.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The storage area should be regularly inspected for signs of pests, insects, or rodents. Easy steps such as sealing cracks, using natural repellents, or occasional fumigation can <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/youth/young-innovators/sharanya-mehta-class-12-student-decision-support-system-irrigation-app-rural-farmers-10504004\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">protect your crop from damage</a> over time.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">6. Transport crops carefully and without delay</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Transporting the crop to storage facilities or the market should not be delayed once harvesting and drying are complete. Use clean, covered carts or vehicles to prevent exposure to dust, heat, or rain during transit. Avoid overloading, as this can crush grains or damage pods.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If immediate transport is not possible, store the produce temporarily in a sheltered and dry area until arrangements can be made. Establishing safe transport helps maintain both the quality and quantity of the crop.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">7. Clean and sort before selling</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before crops are sent to market or stored long-term, they should be cleaned and sorted. Remove broken grains, debris, and any foreign material. Sorting the produce by size, shape, or colour not only improves its appearance but also increases its value in the market.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Harvesting kharif crops\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/27/harvesting-kharif-crops-2025-10-27-18-22-09.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Harvesting kharif crops requires attention to detail, good timing, and careful handling Photograph: </em><a href=\"https://www.agrifarming.in/kharif-and-rabi-crops-in-india-a-full-guide\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>(Agri Farming)</em></a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Well-graded,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/247857/agritech-sumit-sheoran-sudhanshu-rai-startup-fyllo-bengaluru-agriculture-farming-water-conservation-success-story-him16/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">clean produce attracts better prices</a> and guarantees a good reputation among buyers.

      "summary": "<p>I love FM radio. It’s okay: You can call me a Luddite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My alarm clock is the local public radio station. I love toggling between a few music stations while driving, or even while reading at home. And during a road trip, there’s nothing quite like discovering a community station with random locals curating their own playlists—it gives you a sense of where you are that no Spotify playlist can match.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem: It’s hard to know what stations exist locally, even in your own town but particularly while on a road trip. You can explore the dial, which has a certain serendipity, but what if you just want to . . . know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>And </em>be able to tune in with or without an actual traditional radio in front of you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This tip originally appeared in the free </em><a href=\"https://theintelligence.com/cool-tools-fc\"><strong><em>Cool Tools newsletter</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong><em>from </em><a href=\"http://theintelligence.com/\"><em>The Intelligence</em></a><em>. Get the next issue </em><a href=\"https://theintelligence.com/cool-tools-fc\"><em>in your inbox</em></a><em> and get ready to discover all sorts of awesome tech treasures!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-old-school-listening-with-a-modern-twist\">Old-school listening with a modern twist</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This exact problem is why I like <a href=\"https://radio-locator.com/\"><strong>Radio Locator​</strong></a>. It’s a free website that lets you enter any city or zip code and find all the terrestrial stations that are available for that area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>➜ It’ll show you a list of every FM <em>and </em>AM station in any U.S. city or zip code. You can also browse international radio stations by country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>⌚ And it all takes just a few seconds<strong> </strong>to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91437873\" height=\"464\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/11/radio-locator.png\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The Radio Locator site is free and as simple as can be.<br /></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a rare service that isn’t cluttered with ads or upselling. Just open the site, type a place, and you’ll see a list. Stations are sorted by frequency, but you’ll also see the call sign, the distance to the tower, and what format of radio station is offered. (I’m personally always looking for public radio or alternative stations, but you can figure out what <em>you </em>want for yourself.)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91437876\" height=\"472\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/11/radio-locator-stations.png\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">You can find info about all sorts of stations, in any geographical area.<br /></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>📲 Of course, all of this only applies if you’ve got an actual-factual FM radio on your hands. What if you’re more of a computer-and-phone kind of person? Easy: Just click through on any of the stations on Radio Locator, and they’ll generally take you to a website where you can stream the station.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>💡 Or, if you prefer a dedicated tool for the job, there’s <a href=\"https://streema.com/\"><strong>​</strong>Streema<strong>​</strong></a>. It’s a free site that makes it easy to search for and stream just about any radio station imaginable, anywhere in the world. A few stations redirect to websites—best I can tell for legal reasons—but the overwhelming majority of the time, you can just search for a website and start listening.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91437877\" height=\"434\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/11/streema.png\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Streema makes most on-demand radio listening a swift click or tap away.<br /></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, you can find and listen to old-fashioned radio stations anytime. Again: I recommend finding public and community stations, as those tend not to have ads, but take the time to explore. It’s nice to get away from the algorithm sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You can open <a href=\"https://radio-locator.com/\">Radio Locator​</a> and <a href=\"https://streema.com/\">​Streema​</a> directly in your web browser on any device. Streema also offers an app called Simple Radio for both <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.streema.simpleradio&amp;hl=en_US\">​Android​</a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/simple-radio-fm-am-stations/id891132290\">​iOS,​</a> if you’d rather go that route.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Radio Locator and Streema are both free in the browser. Simple Radio is free with on-screen ads or you can get an ad-free version for $6 a month.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Neither site requires a login or any real personal data, but you <em>can </em>opt to share your location—if you want.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Treat yourself to all sorts of brain-boosting goodies like this with the free </em><a href=\"https://theintelligence.com/cool-tools-fc\"><strong><em>Cool Tools newsletter</em></strong></a><em>—starting with an instant introduction to an incredible audio app that’ll tune up your days in truly delightful ways.</em></p>",

      "summary": "<p>Two months ago, Apple released iOS 26 for the iPhone. The new operating system includes <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91396318/ios-26-iphone-apple-productivity-hacks-live-translation-call-screening-hold-calendar-events-custom-folder\">several productivity</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91371990/ios-26-new-features-beta-liquid-glass-messages-poll-passport-travel-hold-assist-onscreen-awareness-visual-intelligence-flight-information-wallet\">other enhancements</a>, but the main feature is a new <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91349477/apples-liquid-glass-is-exactly-as-ambitious-as-apple\">design language</a> called Liquid Glass. The flat, minimalist look of iOS that lasted for more than a decade is gone, replaced by a transparent interface of toolbars and buttons that mimic how light bends and warps as it passes through glass.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who appreciate the new look of iOS often praise Liquid Glass as refreshing and unique, saying it gives the iPhone’s software a sense of fluidity that other touch interfaces lack. Others argue that Liquid Glass’s transparent elements make the device harder to use, as the content behind iOS 26’s buttons and toolbars often obscures the symbols or text that label the interface elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you fall into the latter group, there’s some good news. Apple is increasingly providing options to tone down the most controversial aspects of the Liquid Glass design. Here they are:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-option-1-turn-on-the-tint\">Option #1: Turn on the tint</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This week, Apple released its first major update to iOS 26: iOS 26.1. This<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26_1-release-notes/\">update fixed numerous bugs</a> while also adding new features; it expanded Apple Intelligence and AirPods Live Translation features to new countries, added new swipe controls to the Music app, and overhauled the alarm clock interface so you don’t accidentally tap “snooze” and miss your meeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91437573\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/11/LG-CT.png\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The new “clear” (left) and ”tinted” (right) options for Liquid Glass.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But<span style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">&nbsp;as&nbsp;<em>Fast Company</em>&nbsp;previously reported,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91425930/hate-iphone-liquid-glass-download-apple-ios-26-1-beta-4\" target=\"_blank\">iOS 26.1’s best new feature</a>&nbsp;is a toggle that lets users tone down Liquid Glass&#8217;s design</span>. It does this by allowing users to choose between two different Liquid Glass interfaces.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The “Clear” interface is the default Liquid Glass, with interface element transparency at a maximum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The “Tinted” interface option reduces this default transparency to give Liquid Glass elements a more frosted look. This can greatly improve the readability of button and toolbar labels by increasing their contrast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turning on the Liquid Glass tint is easy, as long as you have iOS 26.1 installed on your iPhone:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Open the Settings app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap Display and Brightness.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap Liquid Glass.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap the “Tinted” option.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see from the screenshots above, the &#8220;tinted&#8221; Liquid Glass option brings a frosted look (right) to the default transparency (left).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-option-2-increase-the-contrast\">Option #2: Increase the contrast</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re still on iOS 26.0 or just want to eliminate the default look of Liquid Glass even more on your iPhone that&#8217;s running iOS 26.1, you can tone down Liquid Glass in three other ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91437575\" height=\"404\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/11/LG-IC.png\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The default look of Liquid Glass (left) versus Liquid Glass with the “Increase Contrast” Accessibility option enabled (right)<strong><em>.</em></strong></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first is by enabling the “Increase Contrast” Accessibility option on your iPhone. This feature is designed for users with sight issues, but anyone can enable it, and many have found that doing so makes Liquid Glass more palatable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Apple notes, enabling this setting helps “Increase color contrast between app foreground and background colors.” Here’s how you turn it on:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Open the Settings app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap Accessibility.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap Display &amp; Text Size.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Toggle the “Increase Contrast” switch to ON (green).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see in the screenshots above, enabling the “Increase Contrast” option (right) adds a slight outline around interface borders and adds a grey smokiness to transparent elements, which makes text and buttons easier to see than they are in the default Liquid Glass design (left).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-option-3-reduce-the-transparency\">Option #3: Reduce the transparency</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A third way to tone down Liquid Glass is to enable another Accessibility option on your iPhone called “Reduce Transparency.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91437576\" height=\"402\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/11/LG-RT.png\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The default look of Liquid Glass (left) versus Liquid Glass with the “Reduce Transparency” Accessibility option enabled (right).</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This option tones Liquid Glass down even further than the “Increase Contrast” option, greatly reducing its transparency. As Apple notes, this option helps “Improve contrast by reducing transparency and blurs on some backgrounds to increase legibility.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To enable the setting:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Open the Settings app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap Accessibility.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap Display &amp; Text Size.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Toggle the “Reduce Transparency” switch to ON (green).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see in the screenshot above, enabling the “Reduce Transparency” option (right) virtually blocks any background content from bleeding through buttons and toolbar elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-option-4-outline-buttons-for-easier-visibility\">Option #4: Outline buttons for easier visibility</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A final way to tone down Liquid Glass is to force iOS 26.1 to show borders around buttons and other UI elements. This is done via the &#8220;Show Borders&#8221; Accessibility option.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91437579\" height=\"188\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/11/i-LG-SB.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Enabling &#8220;Show Borders&#8221; (right) can help make some buttons easier to see in Liquid Glass.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This option forces outlines to appear around &#8220;prominent UI,&#8221; according to Apple&#8217;s iOS 26.1 notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To enable the setting:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Open the Settings app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap Accessibility.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap Display &amp; Text Size.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Toggle the “Show Borders” switch to ON (green).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see in the screenshot above, enabling this option displays a thin outline around buttons and other UI elements, helping them stand out more on your screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-liquid-glass-isn-t-going-away\">Liquid Glass isn’t going away</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new look of iOS 26 isn’t temporary—nor should it be. While there have been some vocal detractors to the new design, a large majority of iPhone users seem to love the refreshed look. After Apple spent years developing that new design, there’s no way they would go back to the old one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Apple’s addition of a new “tint” option for Liquid Glass via a dedicated control in the iOS 26.1 Settings app shows that the company is listening to feedback from all its users and is not averse to giving individuals more control over how Liquid Glass looks to them. So, while you may not be able to turn off Liquid Glass, you now at least have three ways to tone it down.</p>",

But our generation grew up with the reality of climate change, animal extinction, and severe air and <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/201010/india-water-pollution-cleaning-complaints-robot-hair-innovation-hair-technology/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">water pollution</a>. Since I was about six years old and learned about these things on National Geographic, this discomfort about a bleak future has stayed with me,&rdquo; explains Angad, in a conversation with <strong>The Better India</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Solving real-world problems has always excited him. A child prodigy from Mumbai, Angad built his first robot and a solar-powered boat at age 8, besides building a homegrown <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/303783/chennai-startup-avay-biosciences-builds-bio-3d-printer-to-print-human-tissues/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">3D printer</a> by 13 and an e-reader (Virtual Brailler) for the visually-challenged by 15. He briefly dropped out of the schooling system because of his disillusionment with the rote learning-based state board system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I found school confusing. While I was doing well academically, the rote-based education didn&rsquo;t build my fundamentals which would become obvious when I&rsquo;d compete in Olympiads and struggle to solve problems. At the same time as a hobby, I was building all these complex engineering projects at home on my own simply by watching videos or reading books. When I dropped out of school, my parents hired a tutor who would teach me all the same things as other high school students, while rebuilding my fundamentals. Since I didn&rsquo;t have homework and was solving problems while learning the topics, I had a lot of free time to focus on my scientific hobbies.&rdquo; he recalls.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During this time, when Angad was around 14 years old, he wrote an email to<a href=\"https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/elevateprize/solutions/29235\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Professor Ramesh Raskar</a>, an Indian-born professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Currently, he&rsquo;s an Associate Professor of media arts and sciences at the renowned MIT Media Lab and an advisor to renowned technology giants like Google and Apple.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amusing looking back at my ignorance, but I wrote to him saying, &lsquo;You are an Indian professor and MIT brings bright young students from around the world to its campus, so why not bring on someone from India?&rsquo; Incredibly, he wrote back almost immediately and I ended up working with MIT via their India Initiative for two years building technology that could solve real-world problems in health tech. Even till this day,<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1204696763436090\"> Professor Raskar</a> remains supportive of my journey and has been an incredible mentor&rdquo; he recalls.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After those two years working with MIT, he went back to an IB (International Baccalaureate) school, following which he studied electrical engineering at the prestigious Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech). It was during his time in college when he decided to act on the growing problem of air pollution and began developing solutions for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Today, his startup has built one of the &ldquo;world&rsquo;s most advanced air purification technologies&rdquo; using a unique combination of electrical charge dispersion and airflow optimization-based processes - allowing particles to be charged and creating electric fields that move the particles to a collection chamber. Angad combined his background in electrical engineering, product design, IoT, process engineering, and manufacturing to create a whole new class of air purifiers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In short, his solution works through a network of air purifying units that can clean air within large spaces like factory floors in just minutes by mapping how the pollution is flowing on the shop floor and then strategically placing the air purifiers to capture that pollution. For example, Praan's latest product called the MK II (&lsquo;Mach 2&rsquo;) has a high purification rate of 1300 cubic feet per minute.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"The MK II \" class=\"wp-image-338473\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/post_attachments/uploads/2024/01/Praan.io-Image-3-1705505138.jpg\" /><br />\n<figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The MK II</figcaption>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-inspired-by-illness-nbsp\">Inspired by illness&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Growing up in Mumbai, Angad suffered from asthma. Every winter, particularly during the festive season, he would endure breathing difficulties due to high air pollution and his family would have to leave the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;With asthma and high dust levels in the city, I would struggle to play football. I couldn&rsquo;t run properly because my stamina would take a hit and I would cough constantly. But this was a reality for a lot of people living around me. Today, while I can move to a country with a cleaner environment, I can&rsquo;t expect my family and friends to do the same. I couldn&rsquo;t see them breathe this toxic air every day and this is why finding a solution was so important to me,&rdquo; recalls Angad.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In 2017, just before he began his sophomore year at Georgia Tech, he began working on solutions for urban air pollution but this came with some real challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If I used Georgia Tech&rsquo;s infrastructure to build my solution, as per the clauses, they would own all the intellectual property. As a result, I wouldn&rsquo;t have the freedom to commercialise it as per evolving requirements. And hence, commercially, we didn't have access to any of their labs. Also, as a result of my visa status, I legally could not register a company and start a business with a co-founder there while being a college student,&rdquo; he recalls.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;And the truth about building air purification technology is that it's not just the purifier or the sensor you're building, but you're also building the infrastructure to test it in different wind, temperature, humidity, and pollution conditions. Given the lack of financial resources during the bootstrap phase, it was pretty hard to build a safe test chamber that could work in all these different conditions, provide accurate and reliable data and allow you to test with all different materials of dust, gases and pollutants,&rdquo; adds Angad.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a result, Angad started building the prototypes of these filterless purification systems based on physics principles out of his apartment room near Georgia Tech where basic characteristics could be inspected visually.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to<a href=\"https://praan.io/news/praans-story/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> this detailed description</a> on Praan&rsquo;s website, &ldquo;He would carry the prototype for 2 miles several times every week from his apartment to the on-campus makerspace to build the earliest versions of a filterless air purification system. The device first started with a paint-bucket prototype and then made it to a steel ducting system version.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As he continued to work on it, more and more students around campus would find him walking across the lawn with this 5ft-tall metal structure which looked like a jet engine. Out of curiosity, they would talk to him,&rdquo; it adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A couple of weeks later, however, CNN reached out to him to interview for their &lsquo;Tomorrow&rsquo;s Hero&rsquo; series. Following discussions over email, they came down to the Georgia Tech campus and shot a video with him where they discussed his mission, approach and the technology he was building to address urban air pollution. CNN eventually recorded and published this article and<a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/videos/tv/2018/03/27/tomorrows-hero-angad-daryani.cnn\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> video</a> which went viral in no time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to note, however, that Angad wasn&rsquo;t initially interested in building your conventional indoor air purifiers that you can install at home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Despite the commercial appeal, I resisted developing a conventional indoor air purifying system. I was not thinking about the top 1% who can afford a Dyson but that child who walks to school every day or a factory worker breathing in toxic air during his/her shifts. My objective was to find something that can be done for large spaces,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Another important facet was not to involve filters. If I keep a filter-based air purifier at a large space in Delhi during the winter one would have to change the filter every hour. I wanted to build a filterless system, which means no recurring cost of ownership in these large spaces,&rdquo; he adds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Angad Daryani with an MK II at a factory floor.\" class=\"wp-image-338472\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/post_attachments/uploads/2024/01/Praan.io-Image-1-1705504986.jpg\" /><br />\n<figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Angad Daryani with an MK II at a factory floor</figcaption>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-power-of-volunteers\">Power of volunteers</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A couple of months after his appearance on CNN, Angad returned to India for the summer where he continued to work on prototyping the devices and testing them in India.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As<a href=\"https://praan.io/news/praans-story/\"> the Praan website</a> notes, &ldquo;Since this project was entirely bootstrapped with no external financing, all the prototyping was done with off-the-shelf components and built-in Angad&rsquo;s bedroom and terrace in Mumbai, each prototype was hand built, cut, glued, soldered, and tested outdoors. During this process, he kept posting pictures of his progress on the internet.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The explanation goes on to add, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/246668/energy-saving-building-management-system-bios-enlite-research-garima-bharadwaj-gaurav-bali-yos191/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Deeptech</a> was still new in India and hence the availability of risk capital was bleak. So Angad had to bootstrap the project and saw 30 more volunteers join him in his mission as he returned to Atlanta in the Fall 2018. This team was fundamentally trying to figure out if filterless air purification using cold plasma technology was possible and was alternatively also experimenting with bioengineering techniques for purifying air in cities.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Since his team didn&rsquo;t have an office or access to capital, all experimenting of the core tech was done in public parking lots or park benches in Atlanta during after-hours or on weekends. After a couple of months, Angad and his team of over 30 volunteers developed the first prototypes for filterless air purification devices and learned how to design test rigs for building these systems - a process they say they continue to invent and learn from even today, 6 years later.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This was also the time when the project got the name &lsquo;Praan&rsquo;. During this time, Angad and a few members of the team even reached out to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in India to propose a filterless approach to outdoor air purification. Following this, in December 2018, they flew to New Delhi and demonstrated the concept for their first prototype.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Soon after this, the conversations around Praan&rsquo;s mission grew within the Georgia Tech and Emory University Campuses, leading to many more people applying to join the team of volunteers working on this mission. In a fraction of weeks, the team grew to 64 people in the Spring 2019. This was the largest volunteering team [that] Praan ever had,&rdquo; notes the Praan website.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;To develop filterless large space air purification technology, you need persons with different specialisations&mdash;mechanical designers, chemical engineers, physicists, full-stack developers and those with an understanding of power electronics and embedded hardware, among others. When I started developing this technology in my sophomore year, I knew how to build prototypes but knew nothing about fluid dynamics,&rdquo; Angad tells The Better India.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Each version of Praan&rsquo;s purifier was hand-built, soldered, and tested by Angad and his team in small Mumbai spaces.\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/11/05/featured-img-2025-11-05-18-47-56.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Each version of Praan&rsquo;s purifier was hand-built, soldered, and tested by Angad and his team in small Mumbai spaces.</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>So, how do you entice student volunteers to work on your project?&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>&ldquo;You give them recognition on patents, which is very valuable for a third or fourth-year engineering student. And if you can give them real hands-on skills, which they are practising through that semester, they have a good story to tell to job recruiters. Plus, given my prior experience at MIT and the network I developed there, I knew senior people who worked in companies like Apple, Tesla or SpaceX. I could help introduce these volunteers to these people, saying they worked on my project. For example, Patrick Finley, the founder of<a href=\"https://landerchallenge.space/team\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Lander Challenger</a>, went to work at SpaceX after working as a volunteer for Praan,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the following summer, Angad returned to India with one of his Teaching Assistants (TAs) and ran further experiments at a store room belonging to his father&rsquo;s company. Meanwhile, Naresh Shahani (currently a director at Praan), helped obtain an unsecured loan of $15,000 to fund the research and development. Taken in Angad&rsquo;s name, this sum was eventually doubled and returned in 2021.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Later that summer, Angad, his TA and two interns put together the prototype of what would become the MKOne Outdoor Air Purifier. The plan moving forward was that Angad would graduate in 2020, run this company full-time after graduating, and raise capital. Despite his best efforts, securing funding was a major challenge. By January 2020, investors hadn&rsquo;t caught on to the potential of deep tech and the offers on the table were not satisfactory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite these challenges, he managed &ldquo;to pool together some soft commitments worth $1.35M from an Indian VC fund and a few strategic angels on very bad investment terms&rdquo;. As these deals were being finalised, the COVID-19 pandemic struck and everything fell apart. Yet to graduate from college, he had to pack everything up and come back to India while completing online classes to get his degree.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But there was a silver lining. Since people were losing their jobs and internships, there were many looking to work on something that would advance their careers. Similar to what he did earlier, Angad offered recognition on Praan patents to anyone who helped develop the technology further either remotely or even as a volunteer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In total, Praan managed to onboard about 60 volunteers from multiple time zones who chose to dedicate about four months of their time to work on their technology.&nbsp; While the hardware was built and developed out of Angad and his intern&rsquo;s bedrooms in <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/337225/volunteer-beach-cleanup-akshat-shah-shubh-mehta-mumbai-new-year-resolution/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mumbai</a>, other volunteers from around the world contributed with their ideas and engineering drawings for their prototypes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to the Praan website, there were also &ldquo;design teams working on ideas for the MK One product, the indoor air purification, bioengineering, carbon capture, and software engineering products&mdash;all without any capital in the bank&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Real funding and assistance finally came in the form of Emergent Ventures, a fellowship and grant programme run by famous economist Dr. Tyler Cowen. It gave this fledgling startup the largest grant during the lockdown period which helped them access capital to build prototypes and test rigs as well. In the next few months, they developed a working prototype of the MKOne Outdoor Air purifier in India.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, there was very little customer or investor interest and a negligible amount of vendors were willing to manufacture the MKOne prototype. Angad spent about five months waiting for vendors to manufacture the first usable MKOne prototype. Tired of waiting, Angad decided &ldquo;to build the first MKOne prototype at a utensil manufacturing plant.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While there were differences between this prototype and future products in terms of dimensions and finishing, they finally had a real product that they could show investors.

The MK-II device was designed for industrial use cases&mdash;factory floors where there are incredibly high dust volumes and levels.

He filled his truck with diesel and topped up with petrol. Then he entered the station and ordered a couple of iced coffees. When he went to pay, things went sideways.</p><p>Crawley had transferred all his <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/money-quotes/\">money</a> to a new bank account the night before and realized he didn’t have his new bank card on him. He tried to pay from a joint account but, for the life of him, could not remember the PIN.</p><p>“After searching through my iPhone bank app to figure out how to reset my PIN I had failed,” Crawley <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tyson.crawley/posts/pfbid02aPhBbZjH8JnRLjfbYnQJ26w9FeRhgfk62tghon6zzREzmtcHtnyWNPJe6MGyCf1Dl\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recalled in a Facebook post</a>. “My dog was barking wildly, I had to get to work, and I was starting to freak.”</p><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/single-mom-gives-stranger-money-christmas-the-rock/\" target=\"_self\">Single Mom Gives Stranger $7 for Christmas – Then, He Leads Her to the Parking Lot</a></p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Surprise: A Stranger Had Him Covered</strong></h2><p>As Crawley began panicking, a man who had purchased a coffee right before him and exited the store witnessed the ordeal. He came back inside.</p><p>“Do you need some money?” he asked.</p><p>Crawley said no, that he just couldn’t remember his code, and it was okay. The man said it was fine, and then walked around to the register. When Crawley realized what he was doing, he insisted it was okay; he had the money but just needed to figure out his PIN.</p><p>“It’s a free country, isn’t it?” the stranger asked. “I can help a brother out, can’t I?”</p><p>Crawley was stunned. The bill was $110, but eventually, he accepted the <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/kindness-quotes/\">kind</a> man’s help. He then passed him the receipt and asked him to write down his number so that he could contact him and pay him back immediately.</p><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/reddit-comment-stranger-leave-abusive-relationship/\" target=\"_self\">Stranger Gives Woman Advice About Her Toxic Relationship – Receives an Unexpected Email From Her 6 Years Later</a></p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Final Twist: A Follow-Up Request</strong></h2><p>The attendant, whom Crawley said was just as stunned as he was, passed the man a pen. The stranger wrote on it, folded it down, and handed it to Crawley. Crawley was so overwhelmed and grateful that he insisted they take a photo together. Then the man left. </p><p>“I turned around to the attendant and she said, ‘Well that doesn’t happen every day,’” Crawley recalled. “I turned around to leave, and he was gone, literally gone. I went outside and could not see him anywhere.”</p><p>It was then that Crawley opened the receipt to look at the number and he received another shock. Instead of a phone number, the man had written down his name along with three game-changing words.</p><p>“John. Pass it on.”</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"pass it on written a receipt\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f6725\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/pass-it-on-written-a-receipt.png?id=54995389&amp;width=980\" />\n<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tyson.crawley/posts/pfbid02aPhBbZjH8JnRLjfbYnQJ26w9FeRhgfk62tghon6zzREzmtcHtnyWNPJe6MGyCf1Dl\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tyson Crawley / Facebook</a></small></p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Paying It Forward</strong></h2><p>Crawley wrapped his Facebook post with an important reminder.</p><blockquote>“Please be beautiful people, and remember it's not about keeping up with the joneses, having the biggest house, most expensive car, the largest bank account, but work with each other, after all, what is money compared to the quality of human life?” he wrote.</blockquote><p>Money comes and goes, but who we are as people and how we interact with one another is the essence of our being. Helping each other out when times are tough, even when we don’t know the person, is what makes us human, and what can make this life so beautiful.</p><p>So the next time you’re in a position to pay it forward, why not? Go ahead and buy that coffee for the person behind you. Pay that parking meter that’s about to expire for a total stranger. Donate toys to a toy drive, leave a super generous tip, or give a secret gift.</p><p>At the end of the day, it’s how we show up for each other and help one another out that matters. Everything else is just extra. <3</p>",

No iPads</h3><p><em>“All I’m going to say is my kid has a whole world to explore and none of that has to do with being stuck in front of a tablet.”</em></p><h3>2. No smartphone until high school</h3><p><em>“Kids that are younger than that age do not know internet safety to a point where I feel comfortable letting them have free reign of the internet.”</em></p>   <h3>3. Teaching the value of education</h3><p><em>“What I’m going to teach them is [education] has nothing to do with how much money you’re making or how successful you’ll be professionally. But you will still value it, nonetheless. You will go with it as far as you possibly can, and then once you’re done with it, you can do whatever you want.”</em></p><h3>4. Respect your teachers and treat them well</h3><p><em>“This may be biased because I am a teacher, but everyone who has gone through a professional degree program and has put in the time and is there, giving you the quality education, deserves some type of attention and deserves to be treated well.”</em></p><p><em><br /></em></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e3a87\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk4OTUyOC9vcmlnaW4uZ2lmIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5MDk1ODY4NH0.WpMNyaTRUsnXhcLHgfLWhAxP-msKTezPLu0uFMKgdsk/img.gif?width=980\" />                <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">                <a href=\"https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExZzZoNDN6aWswamthMnNnbWY3cWowdnNncnJkanMwcGN2ZzFqNXdoaSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/lQPHNPMPZ7tcIwseGn/giphy.gif\" target=\"_blank\">media3.giphy.com</a>        </small>        </p><h3>5.

Yes, ma’am</h3><p><em>“It does not matter your age or status in society, as long as they are respecting their pronouns, that’s how we’re gonna be talking to other people.”</em></p><h3>7. Greetings and gratitude</h3><p><em>“Simple greetings and simple terms of gratitude are just not being taught like they used to. I think it’s really sad.”</em></p><h3>8. Consequences for poor behavior</h3><p><em>“If they’re neglecting their schoolwork and not doing what they’re supposed to do, they get their technology taken away. … Simple things like this are pretty common sense and I’m not sure why they’re not being done anymore.”</em></p><h3>9. Respect adult conversations and spaces</h3><p><em>“They don’t get to interrupt 2 adults speaking to each other. They don’t get to come and butt in at an inappropriate time when 2 people are talking to each other.\"</em></p><h3>10. Clean your mess</h3><p><em>“My child is going to put as much work in the house as we are regardless of whether he’s paying rent out of his own pocket or not. That’s because when my son becomes an adult, I want him to be a partner or a spouse or a roommate that someone is proud to have around.”</em></p><p><em><br /></em></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f2bdc\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk4OTUxOC9vcmlnaW4uZ2lmIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NTc0Mjk5NH0.ucQ0_c390MdXUGPuXZKMBE4mJ7lq5Nov_aipgTETXiY/img.gif?width=980\" />                <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">                <a href=\"https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExOW9hcGF4aDNjdGZ0Z204dnhqc253eHU4Ynp1NXFnODdtbnIwZGs0YyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/HIrYP4RI9DpLy/giphy.gif\" target=\"_blank\">media3.giphy.com</a>        </small>        </p><h3>11.

      "summary": "<p>For decades now, tech companies have been promising us a future straight out of <em>Star Trek</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of being confined to phones and computers, our digital lives would extend to a network of screens all around us, from connected TVs and smart fridges to kitchen countertop displays and car dashboards. The tech companies called this &#8220;ambient computing&#8221; or &#8220;ubiquitous computing&#8221; and extolled how it would get technology out of the way so we could focus on the real world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve got instead:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Samsung&#8217;s smart refrigerators, which range from $1,899 to $3,499, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/samsung-makes-ads-on-3499-smart-fridges-official-with-upcoming-software-update/\">have started showing advertisements on their screens</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amazon&#8217;s Echo Show smart displays now <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/dont-buy-an-echo-show-you-can-have-mine-155730401.html\">have ads that you can&#8217;t turn off</a>, even <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/report/797672/amazon-echo-show-ads-alexa-plus\">if you&#8217;re paying $20 per month for the upgraded Alexa+ assistant</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amazon also shows &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.techhive.com/article/2116401/how-to-turn-off-fire-tv-screensaver-ads.html\">Sponsored Screensavers</a>&#8221; on its Fire TV devices if you leave them alone for a few minutes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tesla recently <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2025/10/10/tesla-pushes-tron-ares-ad-inside-cars-upsetting-owners/\">pushed a promotion</a> for Disney&#8217;s <em>Tron: Ares</em> to its car dashboards.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>They got the ambient part right, in that we&#8217;ve now surrounded ourselves with screens we don&#8217;t control. But instead of blending into the background, the screens are now doing the opposite, distracting us with ads in hopes of padding their makers&#8217; bottom lines.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-promises-made\">Promises made</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ambient computing got its start <a href=\"https://resenv.media.mit.edu/classarchive/MAS961/readings/weiser_origins.pdf\">in a more idealistic setting,</a> in the late 1980s at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. Mark Weiser, then the head of PARC&#8217;s computer science lab (and later its chief technology officer) used the term &#8220;ubiquitous computing&#8221; to describe how an array of screens in various sizes—&#8221;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20141022035044/http://www.ubiq.com/hypertext/weiser/SciAmDraft3.html\">tabs, pads and boards</a>&#8220;—would all work in tandem to help people accomplish everyday tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Machines that fit the human environment, instead of forcing humans to enter theirs, will make using a computer as refreshing as taking a walk in the woods,&#8221; he wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tech companies started dusting off the idea a couple decades later, as lightweight processors, low-cost displays, and widespread internet connectivity made ambient computing more feasible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2013, for instance, Microsoft opened an &#8220;<a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/step-inside-the-microsoft-envisioning-center/\">Envisioning Center</a>&#8221; to test its ambient computing ideas, including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_zEijoYRv0\">head-to-toe touchscreens for kitchens and common areas</a>. Cisco demoed a &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.etcentric.org/nab-2013-cisco-unveils-vision-of-its-second-screen-2-0\">Second Screen 2.0</a>&#8221; concept, with screens that could blend into the surrounding walls and provide personalized information as needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Samsung had an even bolder vision, releasing a &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0IR40ud0jU\">Display Centric World</a>&#8221; concept video full of rollable, foldable, and transparent displays. &#8220;Technology begins with a love for you,&#8221; the video declared, before showing how Samsung&#8217;s screens would someday wrap around coffee cups, unfurl from night stands, light up inside car windows, and cover classroom walls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The term &#8220;ambient computing&#8221; took hold a few years later. In 2017, the tech columnist Walt Mossberg used the term to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/25/15686870/walt-mossberg-final-column-the-disappearing-computer\">describe technology that got out of your way</a>, and pretty soon both Google and Amazon were running with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The technology just fades into the background when you don’t need it,&#8221; Rick Osterloh, Google&#8217;s SVP of devices and services, <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/google-and-ambient-computing/\">declared during a 2019 keynote</a>. He continued to describe Google&#8217;s constellation of connected phones, watches, speakers, and smart displays as &#8220;ambient computing&#8221; in the years that followed, and in 2022 called it the company&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90751095/google-is-betting-big-on-ambient-computing-but-its-getting-it-wrong\">north star</a>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave Limp, Amazon&#8217;s former senior vice president of devices and services favored the similar term &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22696187/amazon-alexa-ambient-disappearing-computer-limp-interview\">ambient intelligence</a>,&#8221; describing how cloud computing would power a network of smart gadgets from Echo speakers to Fire TV streaming players. An <a href=\"https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/2021/07/building-a-world-of-ambient-computing-together\">Amazon Developer blog post</a> from 2021 declared that &#8220;ambient is the future,&#8221; and would &#8220;make life easier and better without getting in your way.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the stuff of imagination, ambient computing had arrived in earnest, but there was a problem: The utopian ideal was at odds with how these companies make money.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cheap-screens-you-can-t-control\">Cheap screens you can&#8217;t control</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not enough to merely sell the device, be it a smart speaker, connected TV, or fridge with a built-in screen. Instead, tech companies expect these devices to generate revenue over time through ads or subscriptions. In some cases they sell these products at <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/01/08/vizio-smart-tvs\">aggressively low prices</a> in hopes of recouping the investment later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the software that runs on these inexpensive screens provide far less control than a computer or even a phone. These are increasingly dumb terminals with software controlled through the cloud, which means you have little recourse when that software turns against you. While you can swap out the search engine on your computer <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91038374/kagi-web-search-engine-google-alternative\">with one that doesn&#8217;t fill the screen with ads</a>, no such alternative exists when your smart display starts cycling through banner ads or <a href=\"https://www.amazonforum.com/s/question/0D54P00007m2nVXSAY/how-do-i-stop-alexa-from-advertising-to-me-even-when-in-brief-mode\">using voice responses to upsell shopping items</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The hardware isn&#8217;t exactly simple to replace, either. You might be comfortable tossing out a single smart display or speaker, but what if you&#8217;ve filled your home with them and built an entire smart home system around them? And what happens when your TVs, fridges, and car dashboards become digital billboards well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all this in mind, those flashy Samsung and Microsoft concept videos from the early 2010s take on a different flavor. These companies sold us on a digital utopia powered by pervasive screens and connected software without ever explaining how they&#8217;d pay for it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we&#8217;re surrounded ourselves with the technology to make it possible, the bill is finally coming due.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>The latest generation of <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">artificial intelligence</a> models is sharper and smoother, producing polished text with fewer errors and hallucinations. As a philosophy professor, I have a growing fear: When a polished essay no longer shows that a student did the thinking, the grade above it becomes hollow—and so does the diploma.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem doesn’t stop in the classroom. In fields such as law, medicine, and journalism, trust depends on knowing that human judgment guided the work. A patient, for instance, expects a doctor’s prescription to reflect an expert’s thought and training.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/artificial-intelligence\" title=\"AI\">AI</a> products can now be used to support people’s decisions. But even when AI’s role in doing that type of work is small, you can’t be sure whether the professional drove the process or merely wrote a few prompts to do the job. What dissolves in this situation is accountability—the sense that institutions and individuals can answer for what they certify. And this comes at a time when <a href=\"https://www.pew.org/en/trend/archive/fall-2024/americans-deepening-mistrust-of-institutions\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">public trust in civic institutions is already fraying</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I see education as the proving ground for a new challenge: learning to work with AI while preserving the integrity and visibility of human thinking. Crack the problem here, and a blueprint could emerge for other fields where trust depends on knowing that decisions still come from people. In my own classes, we’re testing an authorship protocol to ensure student writing stays connected to their thinking, even with AI in the loop.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-when-learning-breaks-down\">When learning breaks down</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The core exchange between teacher and student is under strain. A <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.08872\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recent MIT study</a> found that students using large language models to help with essays felt less ownership of their work and did worse on key writing‑related measures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students still want to learn, but many feel defeated. They may ask: “Why think through it myself when AI can just tell me?” Teachers worry their feedback no longer lands. As one Columbia University sophomore told <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/07/07/the-end-of-the-english-paper\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New Yorker</em></a> after turning in her AI-assisted essay: “If they don’t like it, it wasn’t me who wrote it, you know?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Universities are scrambling. Some instructors are trying to <a href=\"https://tilt.colostate.edu/how-do-i-ai-proof-my-assignments/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">make assignments “AI-proof,”</a> switching to personal reflections or requiring students to include their prompts and process. Over the past two years, I’ve tried versions of these in my own classes, even asking students to invent new formats. But AI can mimic almost any task or style.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understandably, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/opinion/culture/ai-chatgpt-college-cheating-medieval.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">others</a> now call for a return to what are being dubbed “<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/08/31/ai-cheating-colleges-universities-medieval-education-oral-instruction-exams/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">medieval standards</a>”: in-class test-taking with “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_book_exam\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blue books</a>” and oral exams. Yet those mostly reward speed under pressure, not reflection. And if students use AI outside class for assignments, teachers will simply lower the bar for quality, much as they did when <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-36256-4\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">smartphones</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/13/nx-s1-5571050/social-media-teens-brains-reading-memory\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">social media</a> began to erode sustained reading and attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many institutions resort to sweeping bans or hand the problem to <a href=\"https://academictech.uchicago.edu/detection-software/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ed-tech firms</a>, whose detectors log every keystroke and replay drafts like movies. Teachers sift through forensic timelines; students feel surveilled. Too useful to ban, AI slips underground like contraband.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge isn’t that AI makes strong arguments available; books and peers do that, too. What’s different is that AI seeps into the environment, constantly whispering suggestions into the student’s ear. Whether the student merely echoes these or works them into their own reasoning is crucial, but teachers cannot assess that after the fact. A strong paper may hide dependence, while a weak one may reflect real struggle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, other signatures of a student’s reasoning—awkward phrasings that improve over the course of a paper, the quality of citations, general fluency of the writing—are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-03046-z\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">obscured by AI</a> as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-restoring-the-link-between-process-and-product\">Restoring the link between process and product</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Though many would happily skip the effort of thinking for themselves, it’s what makes <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-does-ai-affect-how-we-learn-a-cognitive-psychologist-explains-why-you-learn-when-the-work-is-hard-262863\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">learning durable</a> and prepares students to become responsible professionals and leaders. Even if handing control to AI were desirable, it can’t be held accountable, and its <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/suicide-by-chatbot-puts-big-tech-in-the-product-liability-hot-seat-265550\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">makers don’t want that role</a>. The only option as I see it is to protect the link between a student’s reasoning and the work that builds it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine a classroom platform where teachers set the rules for each assignment, choosing how AI can be used. A philosophy essay might run in AI-free mode—students write in a window that disables copy-paste and external AI calls but still lets them save drafts. A coding project might allow AI assistance but pause before submission to ask the student brief questions about how their code works. When the work is sent to the teacher, the system issues a secure receipt—a digital tag, like a sealed exam envelope—confirming that it was produced under those specified conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn’t detection: no algorithm scanning for AI markers. And it isn’t surveillance: no keystroke logging or draft spying. The assignment’s AI terms are built into the submission process. Work that doesn’t meet those conditions simply won’t go through, like when a platform rejects an unsupported file type.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://sites.temple.edu/cilab/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">my lab at Temple University</a>, we’re piloting this approach by using the authorship protocol I’ve developed. In the main authorship check mode, an AI assistant poses brief, conversational questions that draw students back into their thinking: “Could you restate your main point more clearly?” or “Is there a better example that shows the same idea?” Their short, in-the-moment responses and edits allow the system to measure how well their reasoning and final draft align.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The prompts adapt in real time to each student’s writing, with the intent of making the cost of cheating higher than the effort of thinking. The goal isn’t to grade or replace teachers but to reconnect the work students turn in with the reasoning that produced it. For teachers, this restores confidence that their feedback lands on a student’s actual reasoning. For students, it builds <a href=\"https://www.learningscientists.org/blog/2024/5/23-1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">metacognitive awareness</a>, helping them see when they’re genuinely thinking and when they’re merely offloading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe teachers and researchers should be able to design their own authorship checks, each issuing a secure tag that certifies the work passed through their chosen process, one that institutions can then decide to trust and adopt.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-humans-and-intelligent-machines-interact\">How humans and intelligent machines interact</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are related efforts underway outside education. In publishing, <a href=\"https://authorsguild.org/human-authored/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">certification efforts</a> already experiment with “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/oct/15/books-by-people-for-people-publishers-launch-certification-human-written-ai\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">human-written” stamps</a>. Yet without reliable verification, such labels collapse into <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/section/marketing\" title=\"Marketing\">marketing</a> claims. What needs to be verified isn’t keystrokes but how people engage with their work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That shifts the question to cognitive authorship: not whether or how much AI was used, but how its integration affects ownership and reflection. As <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/09/29/if-ai-can-diagnose-patients-what-are-doctors-for\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">one doctor</a> recently observed, learning how to deploy AI in the medical field will require a science of its own. The same holds for any field that depends on human judgment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I see this protocol acting as an interaction layer with verification tags that travel with the work wherever it goes, like email moving between providers. It would complement technical standards for verifying <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#what-is-a-verifiable-credential\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">digital identity</a> and <a href=\"https://c2pa.org\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">content provenance</a> that already exist. The key difference is that existing protocols certify the artifact, not the human judgment behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without giving professions control over how AI is used and ensuring the place of human judgment in AI-assisted work, AI technology risks dissolving the trust on which professions and civic institutions depend. AI is not just a tool; it is a cognitive environment reshaping how we think. To inhabit this environment on our own terms, we must build open systems that keep human judgment at the center.</p>\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/eli-alshanetsky-2484303\">Eli Alshanetsky</a> is an assistant professor of philosophy at <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/institutions/temple-university-868\">Temple University</a></em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article is republished from </em><a href=\"https://theconversation.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Conversation</a><em> under a Creative Commons license.

And with the holidays on the horizon, one doctor is gently reminding folks the importance of partying responsibly—during the holidays and all year round.</p><p><a href=\"https://pages.doctorhoeflinger.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Brian Hoeflinger</a>, an Ohio based neurosurgeon with over two decades of experience, has a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@doctorhoeflinger\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TikTok channel</a> filled with educational videos and lifestyle tips. In late 2022, smack-dab in the middle of the holiday season, Dr. Hoeflinger shared a clip explaining just how long it takes our bodies to break down alcohol, and it went viral. In the video, which was shared on Christmas Eve of that year, Dr. Hoeflinger sets the scene of a party where “a lot of drinks are going down” by setting up a bunch of shot glasses filled with water.</p><p>“Say you’re having five drinks in the first hour,” he says, taking five water-filled shots. “As you’re taking them, that alcohol is building up in your system fast. [It] goes to your brain within five minutes and starts to affect you.\"</p><p>The same can’t be said for other parts of the body. As Dr. Hoeflinger noted, “Your liver only metabolizes one ounce of alcohol per hour.” And according to <a href=\"https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/alcohol-and-the-brain#:~:text=It%20is%20absorbed%20through%20the,your%20liver%20starts%20processing%20alcohol.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Northwestern Medicine</a>, that process only begins 20 minutes after consumption.</p><p>Hoeflinger continues, “I've got five ounces of liquor in my system right now, and at the end of the hour I'm only going to burn off an ounce…so I'm going to have [four] ounces left in my bloodstream.”</p><blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@doctorhoeflinger/video/7180782044249623854\" class=\"tiktok-embed\">\n        <section>\n            <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@doctorhoeflinger\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@doctorhoeflinger\">@doctorhoeflinger</a>\n            <p>Knowing this about drinking could save your life! #fyp #party #drinking #alcohol #foryou #holiday #christmas</p>\n        </section>\n    </blockquote>\n                            <p>Of course, there are different factors—such as body mass, hormones, medications, etc.—that affect someone’s <a href=\"https://consensus.app/questions/alcohol-absorption-rate/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">rate of absorption</a>. And yes, we might be able to form a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/alcohol-tolerance\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">functional tolerance</a> where behaviorally, we show no signs of intoxication. However, even with all these variables, for the most part all bodies are <a href=\"https://caps.ucsc.edu/counseling/aod/alcohol-facts-tips.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">affected by alcohol similarly</a>. In other words, your blood alcohol level will be more or less the same, and the risks will remain even if you don't \"feel drunk.\"</p><p>Hoeflinger continues, saying, “The party’s rockin’, so we’re gonna have some more,” while taking three more shots and reminding viewers that he still has only burned off one ounce of liquor during the hour that’s passed.</p><p>Now he’s had a total of eight ounces of alcohol in two hours. He’s burned off two, but still has six ounces left in his system—meaning that in this scenario, it will take another six hours to completely burn off.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"shots, alcohol, holiday, party, halloween, christmas, new years eve\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f4802\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjAwMTg2Ny9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NjIxNDk2M30.Sh7J8KZuQ624IMl4b2f0hK9bXG2IhxIkWUcWG0JSI68/img.png?width=933&amp;height=630&amp;quality=50&amp;coordinates=135%2C0%2C132%2C0\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Shots</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos/\" target=\"_blank\">via Canva Photos.</a></small></p><p>In hour three, Hoefligner takes one shot since the party is “winding down.” This brings him up to a total of nine ounces of alcohol over three hours. His liver has metabolized three ounces, leaving him (still) with six ounces of liquor left in his bloodstream.</p><p>“You’re going to be drunk well into the wee hours of the morning; it doesn’t wear off,” he warns, noting the common misconception people have that “they stop drinking an hour or two and can hop in the car and drive.\" But in reality, \"You can't do that as you're still drunk five, six hours down,” he explains.</p><p>Dr. Hoeflinger concludes his video by saying:</p><p>\"For this holiday season the whole point is I really want to tell people that's how alcohol can stack up in your system easily when you're drunk and you won't know it and it won't wear off for hours and hours down the road.\" This is followed by an urge for people to take an Uber or Lyft home to avoid potentially taking their own or another’s life.</p><p>The informative clip, which has since been viewed over 19 million times, received a flood of praise from viewers online, especially from parents with kids of a drinking age.</p><p>“This is the first time I have ever had anyone explain this in this way. I am forwarding this to my son,” wrote one parent.</p><p>It also resonated among designated drivers. One person commented, “thank you for caring and educating. I’m the sober ride. I've seen the devastation from drinking and driving.”</p><p>The topic hits Dr. Hoeflinger on a personal level as well. In a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@doctorhoeflinger/video/7180439326407265582?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">previous video</a>, he shared that he lost his 18-year old son nearly a decade ago from drunk driving. Coming from a medical professional, the plea to not drink and drive is important to hear. But as a parent, it hits different. As he shared in the clip, “Losing somebody you love is one of the worst experiences you can have in your life.”</p><blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@doctorhoeflinger/video/7180439326407265582\" class=\"tiktok-embed\">\n        <section>\n            <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@doctorhoeflinger\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@doctorhoeflinger\">@doctorhoeflinger</a>\n            <p>Have a plan this holiday season.  Don’t Drink and Drive #for you #fyp #drinking #uber #lyft #drunk #holidayseason #responsible #fun</p>\n        </section>\n    </blockquote>\n        <p>Though Hoeflinger focused on the effect of liquor in his party example, the principle applies to wine and beer as well. <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/how-long-does-it-take-for-alcohol-to-kick-in#tips\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Healthline</em></a> recommends only having one large glass of wine every three hours, and one pint of beer every two hours.</p><p>It also gives some best practices to avoid intoxication, including:</p><ul><li>Eat at least one hour before drinking.</li><li>Sip your drinks slowly.</li><li>Avoid shots, which you’re likely to down rather than sip.</li><li>Don’t drink more than one standard drink per hour.</li><li>Alternate between alcohol and nonalcoholic drinks, preferably water.</li><li>Limit or avoid carbonated drinks, like champagne, sparkling wine, and cocktails mixed with soda.</li><li>Sit down when drinking, since doing it while standing tends to make people drink faster.</li></ul><p>And of course, don’t be afraid to get another ride home.

But they also come with their own limitations as well as concerns around cost, privacy, and data protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>➜ That’s why I was so intrigued to come across a new cross-platform location sharing service called ​<a href=\"https://paralino.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>​Paralino​</strong></a>. It attempts to address <em>all </em>of those asterisks with an offering that’s all about giving you an exceptional all-around experience—with privacy and security at the core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically, Paralino promises:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Complete end-to-end data encryption, so only you and the specific people <em>you</em> choose to share with ever see where you go</li>\n\n\n\n<li>No tracking, no profiling, and no ads of any sort</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Intricate control over exactly what info you share with anyone</li>\n\n\n\n<li>And the option to share and receive not only on-demand location info but also proactive alerts (with everyone’s permission) whenever someone in your group arrives at or exits specific places</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91433505\" height=\"1885\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/11/01-private-location-sharing-paralino-alerts.jpeg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Paralino offers both on-demand location sharing and proactive location alerts.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>⌚ You’ll need roughly <strong>two to three minutes</strong> to set it up and try it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>🔽 First, <a href=\"https://paralino.com/download/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">download the Paralino app​</a>. It’s available for both <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.paralino.android&amp;hl=en_US\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">​Android​</a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/paralino-private-phone-finder/id6736908747\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">​iOS​</a>, so you can put it on any phone you (or anyone else you know) might be using.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✅ Then:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Open ‘er up and follow the prompts to create an account and sign in.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You <em>can</em> opt to skip the sign-in and use the service only as a guest, if you want, but doing so makes it impossible to move your setup to another device in the future—so creating an account is really the most advisable way to go.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>When the app prompts you to pick a plan, tap the “x” in the upper-left corner of the screen to skip over that and stick with the service’s standard free level for now.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The free level limits you to a single group for sharing, with one other person and up to two alert-generating places. If you end up really liking the service or wanting more than what the free tier provides, you can always look into Paralino’s premium plans—which range from 40 bucks a year to $70 in the U.S., depending on the specifics—later down the road. But you certainly don’t <em>have</em> to pay and can get quite a bit out of the app’s free level.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Once you reach the app’s main screen, look for the prompts to enable all the pertinent permissions.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The app will ask to be able to send you notifications, so it can actually give you the updates you want, and to be able to see your location all the time—even when you aren’t actively looking at it. It obviously needs that ability to be able to do what it does, and again, its core promise is that it always keeps everything encrypted and never saves any personal data.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, all that’s left is to connect to someone else and start sharing. And then, you can always see exactly where that person is—and vice-versa—as well as get any alerts you both opt into about each other’s locations.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91433506\" height=\"2030\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/11/02-private-location-sharing-paralino-map.jpeg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Once you&#8217;re connected to someone, you can always see their location on a simple map in the Paralino app.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s essentially a more fully featured and privacy-minded version of what Google and Apple offer—and a <em>much</em> <a href=\"https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/12/06/the-popular-family-safety-app-life360-is-selling-precise-location-data-on-its-tens-of-millions-of-user\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">more privacy-respecting</a>, focused, and affordable version of what Life360 provides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s exactly the kind of standard-challenging, small-scale competitor I love to see show up in arenas dominated by big players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>🤳 I’ve been using Paralino with my wife for several days now, and so far, it’s seemed both easy and effective—and true to its promises around privacy and quality. The effect on my battery life has been minimal with the service’s default settings, too, though it seems the app would update our locations more frequently (with the tradeoff of using more battery power) if we switched from the “Balanced” updating frequency to the more aggressive “Best Performance” path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My only real gripe is that the interface for creating an alert-generating place—a specific location where you get notifications when someone arrives and/or leaves—is kinda funky, with no apparent search function and instead only a clunky way to find a place by zooming around on a giant world map. That’s awkward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that one relatively minor quirk aside, Paralino is shaping up to be a solid service and a welcome alternative to the typical options in this area. If you use any sort of location sharing already or think doing so might be beneficial for you, it’s well worth your while to try.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Paralino is available for both <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.paralino.android&amp;hl=en_US\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Android​</a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/paralino-private-phone-finder/id6736908747\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">​iOS​</a>. The company is also working on a fully open source version of its apps for the future</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The service is free, at its base level, with optional upgrades that lift limitations and unlock extra features. (If you do end up pursuing one of those plans at any point, you’ll absolutely want to look at the <em>annual</em> subscription options—which are <em>much</em> better values than their monthly equivalents.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>And, again, this app is all about using strong encryption and avoiding so much as even <em>seeing</em> any manner of personal info—let alone sharing your data with anyone you don’t explicitly approve.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Treat yourself to all sorts of brain-boosting goodies like this with the free </em><a href=\"https://theintelligence.com/cool-tools-fc\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Cool Tools<em> newsletter</em></strong></a><em>—starting with an instant introduction to an incredible audio app that’ll tune up your days in truly delightful ways.</em></p>\n\n\n<hr />",

Wied il-Għasri is a tranquil, picturesque inlet that twists 250 meters inland from the Mediterranean Sea through limestone cliffs towards a small pebble peach on the floor of the gorge.</p>\n<p>This secluded location and lack of amenities allows beachgoers to be at one with nature, as the idyllic scenery and the sound of water gently passing through the canyon provides a soothing aura for all visitors. The only man-made structures to be found are the staircase leading down to the beach, and some small chambers built into the cliffside.</p>\n<p>Aside from sunbathers and swimmers, the valley is popular with snorkelers and scuba divers, owing to clear waters, an abundance of marine life and an underwater network of caves. Most notable is Cathedral Cave, a vaulted dome with a maximum ceiling height 15 meters above the water level. Two shafts hewn from the clifftop to the interior of the cave were previously used as a well to fill the nearby saltpans. A small crack in the cave's ceiling provides light, illuminating the water with a glowing blue hue.</p>\n<p>Malta possesses a seemingly endless supply of golden sandy beaches that attract tourists to its shores. However, this small pebble beach stands apart as one of its most spectacular, and arguably its most unique.</p>",

Always remember that kids mirror us and so we have to show and express our emotions so they will be encouraged to also express their feelings to us. And when we get mad or frustrated, also let them know and explain why and apologize if you feel that you’ve let your emotions get in the way.\"</p><p>While not every child will be able to understand and articulate as clearly as Aldie did at such a young age, most kids are far more capable of understanding and processing emotion than we give them credit for. Proactively teaching them how to communicate what they're feeling and explaining how emotions work can go a long way toward helping them develop the self-regulation tools they'll use throughout their life.</p><p><em>This article originally appeared two years ago. </em></p>",

If you like <em>The Pitt</em>, the names <strong>Samira</strong> and <strong>Heather</strong> have gone up 276 and 116 spots, respectively. <strong>Belinda</strong> climbed a head-turning 2,402 spots, which BabyCenter connects with the show <em>White Lotus. </em>The names <strong>Chelsea</strong> for girls and <strong>Valentin</strong> and <strong>Fabian</strong> for boys have also seen a jump (though not nearly as large as Belinda). And fans of <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em> may be happy to know that <strong>Susannah</strong> shot over 3,000 spots up the chart.</p><p><br /></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"susannah, the summer i turned pretty, names, baby names, \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d632f\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjA4NDY4OS9vcmlnaW4uZ2lmIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5MzQ0NzI5M30.Z1amUQthsOnuOWbAYEZ09R6vd7LcArTsCYTxxdKBs6A/img.gif?width=980\" />        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Susannah has climbed over 3,000 spots on the baby name chart.</small>        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">            <a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/primevideo-oh-the-summer-i-turned-pretty-susannah-Jiy14S0bO9HrotD7iZ\" target=\"_blank\">Giphy</a>        </small>        </p><p>K-Pop bands appear to be having some sway over baby names as well, with BTS's <strong>Jin</strong> rising 699 spots, and Seventeen's <strong>Jun</strong> climbing 1,397 spots.

If you caught <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/5-ways-people-are-going-all-in-for-halloween-this-week\" target=\"_self\"><u>our article last week</u></a>, you already know it means elaborate couple’s costumes, pumpkin carvings that are shockingly lifelike, and Halloween decorations that belong in a museum. But even when it’s not Halloween, the internet is still chock full of examples of people going “all in”—in other words, being their most creative, joyful, and passionate selves, unapologetically and out loud. </p><p>We’ve written a lot about what it means to live this way—and this Friday, we’re continuing the tradition. From senior photos to dog costumes, here are the best examples we’ve found on the Internet this week of people going “all in.” </p><h3>This pacifier funeral</h3><br /><blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@lookitskateeee/video/7568232703116545288\" class=\"tiktok-embed\"> <section> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@lookitskateeee?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@lookitskateeee\">@lookitskateeee</a> Bye bye paci😔🕊️! <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/churchtiktok?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"churchtiktok\">#churchtiktok</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"fyp\">#fyp</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/pacifierweaning?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"pacifierweaning\">#pacifierweaning</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/explore?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"explore\">#explore</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/momlife?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"momlife\">#momlife</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7568232753808870162?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - lookitskateeee\">♬ original sound - lookitskateeee</a> </section> </blockquote> <p>If you’re a parent, you’ve probably been here: Your kiddo has relied on a pacifier to calm them down all throughout infancy and toddlerhood—but now it’s time to leave the pacifier behind, and they’re not quite ready. What do you do? If you’re this hilarious family, you throw an entire funeral so everyone can lay the pacifier to rest once and for all. We can’t get over how elaborate this staged funeral is, from the “mourners” to the piano playing softly in the background as the eulogy is delivered to the BALLOON RELEASE at the end. It's absolute perfection from start to finish. No word yet on how Savannah (the pacifier owner) reacted to the loss of her beloved paci, but if this production doesn’t help her give it up, then probably nothing will.</p><h3>This dog photoshoot </h3><br /><blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@franklinbarkzoo/video/7566680093251161357\" class=\"tiktok-embed\"> <section> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@franklinbarkzoo?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@franklinbarkzoo\">@franklinbarkzoo</a> Replying to @kate <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7566680199731890958?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - franklinbarkzoo\">♬ original sound - franklinbarkzoo</a> </section> </blockquote> We’ve written about couple’s costumes, and we’ve written about group costumes. Now, we’re showing you the best example of being “all in” when it comes to animal costumes. In this video, TikTok creator Lisa Hefferman (who runs a dog walking and boarding service in South Boston called @ultimuttpaws) lines up her extremely well-behaved dogs for a Halloween photoshoot. Lisa’s dedication to getting the perfect shot is definitely something to be admired (“Rufus, you’re, like, <em>too present.”</em>), but we have to give the dogs credit, too. They’re truly going “all in” by being the calmest, most patient, and most cooperative group of pups we’ve ever seen. (Especially the one dressed up as a ghost.) The result is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DQaJmJhjbs6/?img_index=2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>a photo so adorable</u></a> it’s hard to even believe it’s real.

It seems like everybody loves this show—but clearly, nobody loves it more than our friends at All In, who threw an elaborate watch party for the season 2 premiere. The party featured life-size cutouts of the main characters, games (pin the bar on Kristen Bell? Genius), face masks, and of course, delicious snacks. They truly went \"all in.\" </p><p>Speaking of our friends at All In—did we mention their snack bars (featured here in the video) are the perfect example of going \"all in,\" too? Packed with fiber, nuts, and seeds, these bars are the perfect snack who wants something delicious AND chock-full of healthy stuff. </p><p>If that sounds scrumptious (and how could it not?!), you'll be happy to know that you can actually try one <em>for free</em> if you order through Sprouts Farmers Market, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4nxsNts\">here</a>.

A small silver lining, however, is seeing how people in different communities have been stepping up to provide food for their neighbors. In this video, creator @ajpgh412 explains how he started a food pantry in the front yard of his house recently, with help from his sons. When he goes to update TikTok on the pantry’s progress, he’s overcome with emotion: An anonymous donor has left what appears to be hundreds (thousands?) of dollars in his mailbox, along with a note saying, “May God prosper and bless your food pantry.” Talk about going “all in” for your fellow man. We love to see it. <h3>This kid's joyful senior photos</h3><br /><blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@wambamthanksam/video/7561109039229209911\" class=\"tiktok-embed\"> <section> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@wambamthanksam?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@wambamthanksam\">@wambamthanksam</a> Editing these today and I’m HYPE. <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/seniorphotos?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"seniorphotos\">#Seniorphotos</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"fyp\">#fyp</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryou?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"foryou\">#foryou</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/colorado?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"colorado\">#colorado</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/coloradosprings?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"coloradosprings\">#coloradosprings</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7561109207131491085?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - Sam\">♬ original sound - Sam</a> </section> </blockquote> <p>There’s senior photos, and then there’s <em>this kid’s</em> senior photos.

      "summary": "<p>One man’s trash is Danny Shaddick’s treasure. The Toronto architect-artist-musician’s latest work marries recordings of everyday sounds with pieces of scrap metal to create intricate instruments that produce rhythmic soundscapes on their own.</p>\n<p>The project, a collaboration with award-winning Canadian rapper and recording artist Shadrach Kabango, a.k.a. Shad, aims to express the energy of Toronto and represent the city's unique culture.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>“Our creation is a collaborative robot percussion instrument built from reclaimed materials and designed to perform with live vocals,” says Shaddick, who, like Shad, grew up in nearby London, Ontario.</p>\n<p>If that sounds unusual, so was Shaddick’s process: He salvaged pieces from Toronto Transit Commission refuse barns and made field recordings throughout the city, in and around transit vehicles, and down by the water. These recordings were cut and mixed together to create a sonic backdrop to the project’s mechanical centerpiece.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/106088/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p>Next, Shad layered his original lyrics and vocals live on top of the robotic percussive components and found-sound atmosphere. Shad pays tribute to Toronto in verse: <em>“Friends blending machine and machine like / The wide screens so / We represent the scene right ... We make space / Where trees stood in the Great Lakes / Meeting place where new / Relations would take shape.”</em></p>\n<p>The result, Moving Monuments, reframes what a monument can be - not something fixed in place, but the living, breathing movement of the people who give Toronto its rhythm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"article-second-subheading-pre-rd\">Listen to Moving Monuments</h3>\n<p><audio controls=\"controls\" src=\"https://images.atlasobscura.com/aon/hubs/toronto2025/movingmonuments.mp3\"></audio></p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/106094/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p>“Toronto is home, first and foremost,” says Shad, host of Netflix docuseries, “Hip-Hop Evolution.” He’s found the city’s embrace of all genres and rhythms to be unique. “This is a savvy music town.”</p>\n<p>The duo landed on the idea, in part inspired by Toronto’s annual street festivals like Toronto Caribbean Carnival, celebrating the city’s Caribbean community, and Taste of Manila, which centers on Filipino food and culture.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/106093/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p>Shaddick has been passionate about finding the rhythm and music in machinery for decades. A previous project, Robot Orchestra, in which machines played acoustic instruments, was a response to the pandemic physically separating artists.</p>\n<p>“You can invent new music when you invent a new instrument,” Shaddick says.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/106090/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p>With “Moving Monuments,” which looks a bit like a drum machine that wants to be a towering tree, the repurposed parts create their own unique sounds when struck by programmable electronic components. Shaddick also sourced additional pieces from favorite shops, including drums from Soul Drums in Uptown Toronto, shakers from African Drum and Arts Craft on Dundas Street, and cabasas from Steve’s Music on Queen Street West.</p>\n<p>The structural center of the instrument is a standard lighting rig truss, meaning the parts can be attached in dozens of different ways. Shaddick imagines that as the piece travels around the world, showing off the best of Toronto, it can be broken down and reassembled “in ways that are a little bit improvisational,” reflecting the humanity of the automated rhythms. The robot stands tall, covered and surrounded by human elements: local instruments, personal lyrics, the rhythms of Toronto's cultures and community.</p>\n<p>Sustainability is a vital element of all of Danny’s inventive projects. “Danny’s approach to sustainability is, like Toronto, charmingly understated and practically wise,” says Shad.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/106089/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p>Shaddick values how Shad brought an essential lyrical layer to the endeavor. “With this project, it couldn't just be rhythm. It needed more of a soul. It needed a voice. That's where Shad comes in,” Shaddick says of his multidisciplinary collaborator. “He's amazing, an amazing lyricist.”</p>\n<p>Both collaborators hope that the project will bring new attention to the possibilities of combining art and technology as well as to Toronto’s unique mix of sounds and cultures.</p>",

      "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/trifongo-recipe",
      "summary": "<p>Aida Lugo McAllister still remembers the first time she tried Puerto Rico’s unofficial national dish.</p>\n<p>“When I went to Puerto Rico, 1970, at age 17, that’s when I had my first mofongo. And it was heaven,” she remembers. “A mountain of this mashed plantain with pieces of pork in a sauce. Delicious.”</p>\n<p>Mofongo is the first food people bring up when they talk about the island, says Lugo McAllister, a Puerto Rican home cook who has published recipes on her website <a href=\"https://aidaskitchenboricua.com/about-us/\">Aida’s Kitchen</a> and in her bilingual cookbook, <a href=\"https://aidaskitchenboricua.com/\"><em>Aida’s Kitchen a lo Boricua</em></a>. A rich, starchy mash of fried green plantains, garlic, butter, and chicharrón (pork cracklings), it’s the perfect accompaniment to broths and stewed meats. Growing up in Gary, Indiana, Lugo McAllister and her family didn’t have ready access to green plantains, so she didn’t try mofongo until she moved to the island as a teen. But the dish’s impression on her was immediate.</p>\n<p>“So delicious, so moist, and it came in a mortar,” she recalls. She has since published recipes for a <a href=\"https://aidaskitchenboricua.com/healthier-version-of-mofongo/\">“healthier” mofongo</a> (sans pork cracklings) on her website and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slxf1Og4L8I&amp;t=34s\">YouTube</a>. Lugo McAllister is joined by influencers all over the internet who fry and mash plantains in wooden mortars. “When you think of Puerto Rican gastronomy, I’m sure that the first thing you think of is mofongo,” says the content creator Natalia Bercero on <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@mamichanchu/video/7246477103045152046?lang=en&amp;q=mofongo&amp;t=1760029626746\">TikTok</a>, before whipping up the dish for her fans.</p>\n<p>Though it has contemporary appeal, mofongo’s roots are deep. The dish reflects the intertwined histories of African, European, and Indigenous people in Puerto Rico. Taíno people, native to the Caribbean islands, used a pilón, a wooden mortar and pestle, to <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/a-brief-history-of-puerto-ricos-beloved-mofongo-180979947/\">grind ingredients together</a>. Their civilization was <a href=\"https://tainomuseum.org/taino/history/\">flourishing</a> before Christopher Columbus arrived in the Caribbean in 1492. Soon after, Spanish colonists attacked and enslaved the Taíno, putting them to work in gold mines and plantations. So many Taíno died under colonial rule that the Spanish brought enslaved West Africans to the island to replace their dwindling workforce.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/106078/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p>In West Africa, cooks have long prepared fufu, a dish of plantains, yams, or cassava that is boiled, then mashed. Enslaved Africans brought that same technique to Puerto Rico. They also introduced plantains, which grew easily on the island and became “the main source of food for the slaves and the poor people,” said Lugo McAllister, who moved back from Puerto Rico to Indiana in her mid-20s.</p>\n<p>Plantains are closely related to the banana, but in their green, unripe form, they’re not sweet, and can be used as a neutral starch similar to a potato. Over time, African cooks combined plantain-based fufu with European ingredients like garlic, butter, and chicharrón for flavor and moisture. The late food historian Cruz Miguel Ortíz Cuadra wrote in Eating Puerto Rico: A History of Food, Culture, and Identity, that the word “mofongo” comes from an Angolan Kikongo term, <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/a-brief-history-of-puerto-ricos-beloved-mofongo-180979947/\">“mfwenge-mfwenge,”</a> which means “a great amount of anything at all.</p>\n<p>But that doesn’t mean mofongo is a breeze to make. “It’s a food that’s preferred eaten at a restaurant,” said Lugo McAllister. “Because of the many steps involved.” Even some Puerto Rican restaurants <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/a-brief-history-of-puerto-ricos-beloved-mofongo-180979947/\">avoid</a> making the dish because of the amount of elbow grease involved in smashing plantains. Still, mofongo is a cornerstone of Puerto Rican gastronomy, and each restaurant prepares it in its own way. Some serve it in a pilón for extra flare. A soupy main course is typically served on the side or in a well in the middle of the mound.</p>\n<p>In Kissimmee, Florida, where more than half of the city’s 85,000 residents are of Puerto Rican descent, there’s no shortage of good mofongo. The chefs at El Cilantrillo, a Kissimmee restaurant known for delicious cooking, huge portions, and live music, prepare a particularly good one. “I will say that I'm a mofongos tester,” said Yannick Jordan, a Puerto Rican-raised project manager for the company of restaurants that includes El Cilantrillo. “El Cilantrillo’s is still my favorite mofongo that I have ever tried.” On the softer side, with a strong garlic flavor, their mofongo comes in a pilón bearing the restaurant’s name, and can be ordered stuffed with everything from octopus to Impossible Meat. It’s their best seller.</p>\n<p>As with any great dish, mofongo has seen its fair share of spinoffs in recent years. Creative cooks in Puerto Rico and the mainland are trying their own takes on garlicky mashed plantains. There’s Lugo McAllister’s vegetarian mofongo, for example. For a festive appetizer, cooks shape smaller amounts of smashed plantains into little cups and fry them to make <a href=\"https://www.dominicancooking.com/mofonguito-maduro-plantain-cups\">“mofonguitos”</a> that they fill with meat.</p>\n<p>El Cilantrillo is a purveyor of another mofongo innovation: trifongo, a mofongo made with a trifecta of green plantains, yuca (cassava), and maduros (ripe, sweet plantains). Lugo McAllister said that when she first experienced mofongo in the 1970s, trifongo was uncommon.</p>\n<p>The yuca in trifongo is a mildly sweet, <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/22745164/what-is-cassava-how-to-use-cooking-recipes\">starchy tuber cultivated by the Taínos</a> that is now a staple throughout Latin America, Asia, and Africa. El Cilantrillo’s trifongo contains no chicharrón, and gets some extra moisture and umami flavor from chicken broth and seasoning.</p>\n<p>Lugo McAllister says that when it comes to making mofongo, the challenge is in getting the texture right. “It needs to be moist but not greasy,” she says.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/106076/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p>Yuca and plantain are all somewhat dry once they’re mashed, so it’s the job of the cook to add fat and liquid to moisten them. “If you don't put fat or some type of liquid, oh my god, you won't be able to even swallow it,” Lugo McAllister warns. Traditionally, cooks would derive moisture from butter and chicharrón, but many modern mofongos, like El Cilantrillo’s trifongo, are moistened with broth and olive oil. To prevent yourself from overdoing the fat, Lugo McAllister says to add it little by little, tasting to see when the texture is to your liking.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the goal isn’t a puree, but rather a mash with plenty of crispy chunks. Lugo McAllister recommends smashing the starches while they’re still hot from cooking, because they become much harder to manipulate once they cool down. If you don’t have a mortar and pestle, you can put the starches in a stainless steel bowl, cover them with a kitchen towel, and pound them with a mallet. Placing them in a plastic bag and smashing them with the flat bottom of a cup or a pan can work, too.</p>\n<p>Lastly, there’s the flavor. Yuca and green plantain are pretty bland, so salt, garlic, and other seasonings are crucial. “It’s supposed to have a lot of garlic flavor,” Lugo McAllister said. Her healthy take on mofongo includes cilantro, and El Cilantrillo’s gets a flavor boost from adobo, a blend of salt and spices like garlic, pepper, oregano, and turmeric that many Puerto Rican cooks keep on hand. Some cooks make it at home, but it’s also available ready-made in supermarkets.</p>\n<p>The adobo, plus the dance between green plantain, sweet plantain, and cassava makes El Cilantrillo’s trifongo anything but bland. The yuca and maduros add a dimension to mofongo that isn’t ordinarily there, Jordan said. “The cassava is more salty. Sweet plantain, of course, is sweeter. So it's like an explosion in your mouth of these two different flavors.”</p>",

He patented the technique he developed for growing these artificial biomes.

This mural was established as part of the 2013 Paris Design Week. </p>\n<p>Considering its small surface area, this green wall holds an incredible amount of biodiversity in the center of Paris, not just through its vegetation, but also through the birds and insects that thrive within it.

We learned a song about mitosis in grade 9 and i still remember it.\"</p><p>\"I feel like I need a partial refund on my biochem degree because I did NOT get this experience lol.\"</p><p>\"Awww this made me cry, he prepared for this at home, he put his entire soul into it please be kind to him!!!! 🥺\"</p><p>\"Yall better have gotten As, he poured his soul into this 😭😭😭.\"</p><p>McLachlin has the full song up on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@DerekMcLachlin\" target=\"_blank\">his YouTube channel</a> (which frankly should have a lot more subscribers):</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">- YouTube</small>        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">                <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xhZUCCK-UY&amp;t=1s\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com</a>        </small>        </p>            <p>I mean, singing lyrics like \"My brain's singin' like, 'Liver, you know I want ketones, ketones were handmade for brain cells like me, turn them to acetyl groups into Krebs cycle for ATP\" along to a familiar tune? Brilliant. </p><p>Speaking of ATP, he also did a parody of Taylor Swift's \"You Belong With Me\" to explain what ATP does and why it's needed in the body.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">- YouTube</small>        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">                <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b866ub2dOaI\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com</a>        </small>        </p>            <p>What's most excellent about McLachlin's song parodies is that he's clearly been teaching for quite some time, since former students are referencing being in his class at least 15 years ago, and yet he's still coming up with new ways to help students learn the material. When a teacher is that invested in their work, their enthusiasm gets passed onto students. </p><p>The parodied hits just keep on coming. This \"What Makes You Albumin\" version of One Direction's \"What Makes You Beautiful\" explains what albumin is and how it works. It was published just few days before this article was written. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">- YouTube</small>        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">                <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWftagRaSOc\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com</a>        </small>        </p>            <p>We love to see a teacher doing the most and clearly enjoying it. Putting biochemistry concepts into lyrics that fit the music and still make sense cannot be easy, but McLachlin seems to be up to the task. Keep up the excellent work, sir. </p><p>You can follow McLachlin for more biochemistry lessons <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@DerekMcLachlin\" target=\"_blank\">on YouTube</a>. </p>",

In these discarded leaves lies a gift for your garden; they are a natural, free, and potent fertiliser waiting to be unlocked. Leaf mulching is an art as much as it is a science, turning what most people consider waste into a treasure trove for healthy soil.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Imagine walking into your balcony or small garden in early winter, noticing that the beds are covered with a soft, earthy layer of leaves. Beneath this blanket, the soil is quietly changing, retaining moisture, suppressing weeds, and nurturing life from the tiniest microbe to your beloved plants.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The magic of leaf mulching lies not in complicated machinery or chemical concoctions but in a patient rhythm with nature.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why your garden will thank you</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Leaves are nature&rsquo;s own compost packets. As they break down, they release essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium into the soil. The organic matter improves soil structure, encourages beneficial microorganisms, and creates a spongy layer that holds water during dry spells. For <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/446695/grow-amla-in-pots-container-gardening-indian-gooseberry-gardening-steps-grow-in-compact-spaces/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">urban gardeners</a> with limited space and resources, this is an opportunity to work with nature, not against it.</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"leaf mulching healthy garden\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/leaf-mulching-healthy-garden-2025-10-28-17-29-27.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Leaf mulching is an art as much as it is a science.

It is a practice that supports not just plants, but a sense of connection to the natural world.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">How to start your leaf mulch journey</h2>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Collect with care</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Begin with a <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/gardening/october-pruning-guide-indian-gardens-pruning-trees-shrubs-maintenance-home-gardening-tricks-10590306\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">walk around your garden</a>, terrace, or nearby neighbourhood. Gather fallen leaves, choosing those that are healthy and free from disease. If some are damp or curled, don&rsquo;t worry, they will still decompose, though shredding them first speeds up the process. For urban gardeners, a pair of scissors or a lawnmower can turn bulky leaves into manageable pieces.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Shredding: The secret to quick decomposition</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shredded leaves fit snugly around your plants and also decompose faster. Picture them as puzzle pieces; the smaller the pieces, the faster they integrate into the soil. This simple step turns a pile of leaves into a living, breathing layer of humus.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Layer leaves to feed your soil</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Spread a modest layer of shredded leaves, about two to three inches, over the soil. Avoid over-piling; think of it as tucking your garden in for winter. Lightly mixing the leaves with the top layer of soil encourages microbial activity, and over time, these tiny gardeners will turn the leaves into dark and crumbly goodness.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. Water and nurture</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After laying down the mulch, give it a gentle watering. This simple act helps settle the leaves, kickstarts decomposition, and <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/farming/restore-soil-after-monsoon-natural-soil-recharging-compost-soil-fertility-healthy-crops-post-rains-10507957\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">keeps the soil moist</a>. Over the weeks, continue to add new leaves as the old layer breaks down, creating a mulch that evolves with the seasons.</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"leaf mulching healthy garden\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/leaf-mulching-healthy-garden-2025-10-28-17-33-05.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Leaves are nature&rsquo;s own compost packets.

Boosting your mulch&nbsp;</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For gardeners seeking a faster modification, a thin sprinkling of compost or kitchen vegetable scraps over the leaves creates a nutrient-rich cocktail.

      "summary": "<img src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/kate-winslet-and-leo.jpg?id=51672966&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0\" /><br /><br /><p>From declarations of love to laughter on the red carpet, we've rounded up our favorite moments between the legendary Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet that have kept our hearts aflutter for over two decades.</p><p>The now 50-year-old Leo and 49-year-old Kate have had their share of memorable moments. And they're still culturally relevant. The 2023 film <em>Anyone But You</em> had Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell recreate the Jack and Rose \"leaning over the deck of the Titanic\" scene we'll never forget.</p><hr /><h3>Their First Kiss on the set of the Titanic</h3><br /><img alt=\"titanic movie cover\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"4966c\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/titanic-movie-cover.jpg?id=55368691&amp;width=1200&amp;height=800&amp;quality=90&amp;coordinates=0%2C206%2C0%2C386\" /><p>Meeting on the set of <em>Titanic</em> in 1997, DiCaprio and Winslet instantly clicked amidst the gruelling seven-month shoot. Their chemistry was palpable, but both actors have insisted that their bond was purely platonic. Winslet once shared that while her friends were swooning over DiCaprio, to her, he was just “silly old Leo.” This early connection started a friendship that would endure the test of time and Hollywood’s pressures.</p><h3>Oscar Buzz and Romance Buzz</h3><br /><img alt=\"Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio at the Golden Globe Awards\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"7f090\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/kate-winslet-and-leonardo-dicaprio-at-the-golden-globe-awards.jpg?id=52499936&amp;width=1200&amp;height=800&amp;quality=90&amp;coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C262\" /><p>Their friendship has only blossomed over the years, punctuated by countless public appearances that left fans buzzing. Take the 1998 Golden Globes, for instance—Leo and Kate’s camaraderie was on full display as they cheered each other on, despite the endless swirl of romantic rumors. This pattern of mutual support and affectionate displays has persisted, proving that true friendship not only survives but thrives under the bright lights of Hollywood’s spotlight.</p><h3>Reuniting On The Silver Screen</h3><br /><img alt=\"Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet smiling on a couch in Revolutionary Road\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d48e4\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/leonardo-dicaprio-and-kate-winslet-smiling-on-a-couch-in-revolutionary-road.jpg?id=51945688&amp;width=980\" /><p>In 2008, DiCaprio and Winslet reunited on screen for <em>Revolutionary Road</em>, a film about a disintegrating marriage. Despite the intense and somewhat uncomfortable scenes, especially with Winslet’s then-husband Sam Mendes directing, their chemistry was as electric as ever. Winslet later reflected on their effortless ability to fall back into sync, likening it to muscle memory. This reunion showcased their incredible acting skills and highlighted the depth of their enduring friendship.</p><h3>She Thanked Leo (Before Her Husband)!</h3><br /><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span><p>At the 2009 Golden Globe Awards, Cameron Diaz and Mark Wahlberg presented the award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Drama to Kate Winslet for her stunning performance in <em>Revolutionary Road</em>. Winslet, overwhelmed with emotion, took the stage and apologized to the other nominees before expressing her disbelief at winning a second award that night.<br /></p><p>In her heartfelt speech, she thanked the Hollywood Foreign Press, her longtime agents, writer Richard Yates, the film’s cast and crew, the producers, the hair and makeup department, her dialect coach, and, notably, her co-star Leonardo DiCaprio before her husband and the film's director, Sam Mendes. Among the nominees were heavyweights like Anne Hathaway, Angelina Jolie, Meryl Streep, and Kristin Scott Thomas.</p><p>Winslet made sure to acknowledge her longtime friend and <em>Revolutionary Road</em> co-star, saying, \"Leo, I'm so happy I can stand here and tell you how much I love you and how much I've loved you for 13 years. Your performance in this film is nothing short of spectacular.\"</p><h3>Leo Walked Kate Down The Aisle</h3><br /><img alt=\"Moet &amp; Chandon Inside Ballroom at the 64th Annual Golden Globe Awards\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a9a7e\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/moet-chandon-inside-ballroom-at-the-64th-annual-golden-globe-awards.jpg?id=52499919&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;quality=90&amp;coordinates=0%2C33%2C0%2C1771\" /><p>In 2012, during a secret ceremony in New York, it was rumored that Leonardo DiCaprio gave Kate Winslet away at her wedding to Ned Rocknroll (born Abel Smith). This touching gesture demonstrated the depth of their bond, with DiCaprio standing by his friend’s side during one of the most significant moments of her life. This act of friendship showcased the unwavering support and love they have for each other, further cementing their status as one of Hollywood’s most beloved duos.</p><h3>And The Oscar Goes To...</h3><br /><img alt=\"Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, 88th Annual Academy Awards - Backstage And Audience\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"21d77\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/leonardo-dicaprio-and-kate-winslet-88th-annual-academy-awards-backstage-and-audience.jpg?id=52468845&amp;width=980\" /><p>Who can forget the 2016 Oscars when DiCaprio, finally nominated for his role in <em>The Revenant</em>, surprised Winslet on the red carpet? The reunion sparked joy and nostalgia for fans, reminding everyone of their timeless bond that began with <em>Titanic</em>.</p><p>During DiCaprio’s acceptance speech, Winslet couldn’t hold back her tears. As he spoke about the importance of protecting our planet, the camera caught Winslet’s emotional reaction, proving just how much his success meant</p><h3>They Didn't See Each Other For 3 Years!</h3><br /><img alt=\"Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio's emotional reunion during the pandemic\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"10f45\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/kate-winslet-and-leonardo-dicaprio-s-emotional-reunion-during-the-pandemic.jpg?id=52500009&amp;width=980\" /><p>The COVID-19 pandemic posed a significant challenge to their friendship, as travel restrictions kept them apart. Winslet described their emotional reunion after nearly three years as tear-filled and overwhelming, emphasizing how much they missed each other. “I couldn’t stop crying,” Winslet confessed, illustrating the profound connection they share. This reunion underscored the strength of their bond, one that thrives even in challenging times.</p><p>Their friendship was once again in the spotlight during the release of <em>Titanic's</em> 4K Ultra HD edition, where Winslet reminisced about their early days on set. She described young DiCaprio as a magnetic presence, full of energy and freedom, qualities that made working with him a delightful experience. Winslet’s reflections remind us of the joyful and enduring nature of their bond.</p><h3>Nearly 30 Years of Friendship</h3><br /><img alt=\"The 66th Annual Golden Globe Awards - ET Red Carpet Arrivals\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f4001\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/the-66th-annual-golden-globe-awards-et-red-carpet-arrivals.jpg?id=52499993&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;quality=90&amp;coordinates=0%2C17%2C0%2C545\" /><p>Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet’s friendship is a testament to the enduring power of genuine human connection amidst the glitz and glamour of Hollywood. Their story, filled with shared memories, mutual respect, and unwavering support, continues to inspire fans worldwide. In an industry where relationships can often be fleeting, their bond stands out as a heartwarming example of true friendship.</p><p>From their early days on the <em>Titanic</em> set to walking each other down the aisle and supporting each other’s career milestones, DiCaprio and Winslet's friendship reminds us that childhood friends never get old. As Winslet once said, “We’re bonded for life,” a sentiment that perfectly captures the deep and abiding connection they share.</p>",

If you caught <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/5-ways-people-are-going-all-in-this-week-101025\">our article last week</a>, you already know it means elaborate costumes, obsessive birdwatching, and dancing your absolute heart out. At its core, going “all in” is simple: It’s about being your most creative, joyful, passionate self—unapologetically and out loud. </p><p>We’ve written a lot about what it means to live that way—so this Friday, we’re shining the spotlight on people who use Halloween as their ultimate excuse to do just that. W’ere talking costumes. Pumpkins. And especially decorations. Whatever aspect of Halloween is your favorite, you better believe there’s someone going “all in” on it. </p><p>So without further ado: Here are the best examples we’ve found on the Internet this week of people going “all in”—Halloween style. </p><h3>These amazingly creative couple's costumes</h3><br /><blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@almayduh/video/7565297530120981773\" class=\"tiktok-embed\"> <section> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@almayduh?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@almayduh\">@almayduh</a> Beez in the chokey  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/couplescostume?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"couplescostume\">#couplescostume</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/halloween?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"halloween\">#halloween</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/matilda?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"matilda\">#matilda</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/trunchbull?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"trunchbull\">#trunchbull</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/youcandoitbruce?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"youcandoitbruce\">#youcandoitbruce</a> @Libby 💋 ⎕ <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7537176505709808415?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - dj auxlord\">♬ original sound - dj auxlord</a> </section> </blockquote> <p>The best part about Halloween (aside from the candy, of course) is arguably seeing everyone’s creativity on full display. And let’s face it, couples costumes are a perfect way someone can go “all in.” There’s so much imagination here, and so many examples on social media we could hardly pick just one. There’s <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@b.stott/video/7563411999091068215?lang=en\">Miss Lippy and Billy Madison</a>. There’s <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@lenzci___/video/7565332859658046750?lang=en\">Debbie and Fester</a>, from the Adam’s Family. But our favorite this year probably has to go to <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@almayduh/video/7565297530120981773\">Miss Trunchbull and Bruce Bogtrotter,</a> from the movie adaptation of Matilda. Not only do they bear a striking resemblance to the characters, but everything from the style of the costumes to the chocolate smeared on Bruce's face is on point. Well done. </p><h3>This girl's undying love for Michael Meyers</h3><br /><blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@breblc/video/7547904507301154062\" class=\"tiktok-embed\"> <section> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@breblc?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@breblc\">@breblc</a> safe to say p is not afraid of the Halloween decor <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"fyp\">#fyp</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryou?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"foryou\">#foryou</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7547904540163574541?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - breblc\">♬ original sound - breblc</a> </section> </blockquote> <p>Given that the <em>Halloween</em> movie franchise is creeping up on its 50th anniversary (yes, really—we checked, and now we feel old), it’s no surprise that plenty of adults are still obsessed with Michael Myers and his never-ending reign of terror. But toddlers? That’s a new one.</p><p>Still, this little girl can’t get enough. In the <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@breblc/video/7547904507301154062?embed_source=121374463%2C121468991%2C121439635%2C121749182%2C121433650%2C121404359%2C121497414%2C121477481%2C121351166%2C121811500%2C121896267%2C121860360%2C121487028%2C74846152%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%2C121885509%3Bnull%3Bembed_card_play&amp;refer=embed&amp;referer_url=www.upworthy.com%2Fr%2Fentryeditor%2F2674248169%23publish&amp;referer_video_id=7547904507301154062\">now-viral TikTok</a>, she takes her miniature Michael Myers doll everywhere and even naps with him, referring to him as “Michael” and her “baby.” It doesn’t get more adorable than this—even if, you know, her “big buddy” is wielding a knife. It’s clear that even though people our age might know Michael Meyers as a killer, he’s not a horror icon to everyone. To some, he’s just a bestie. </p><h3>Group costumes (and healthy snack bars) </h3><br /><blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@allinsnacks/video/7566027306980904205\" class=\"tiktok-embed\"> <section> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@allinsnacks?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@allinsnacks\">@allinsnacks</a> idk how the spooky font happened but honestly I’m all in for it  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"fyp\">#fyp</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/allin?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"allin\">#allin</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/halloween?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"halloween\">#halloween</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/costumes?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"costumes\">#costumes</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/shrek?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"shrek\">#shrek</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7566027386929171213?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - allinsnacks\">♬ original sound - allinsnacks</a> </section> </blockquote> <p>This company is so committed to going “all in,” they’ve literally baked that phrase into their name. This week, they're showing us that couples aren't the only ones going \"all in\" on costumes this year—there are also small groups dressing up together, and their dedication to the craft is impressive. <br /></p><p>Take this Shrek-themed group, for example. In the video, they reveal their group costume and they look exactly like the characters—particularly Lord Farquad.

The scale of these decorations is beyond impressive, but the attention to detail is even more so.

Working with small batches meant small sample sizes, and the statistical methods of his era simply didn't work well with limited data.</p>\n<p>Gosset's solution would transform not just brewing, but the entire scientific world. Through meticulous experimentation, including early Monte Carlo simulations using random numbers, he developed what became known as the t-test, a method for determining whether results from small samples represent genuine patterns or mere chance variation. The question \"Is this batch of hops truly defective, or did we just get unlucky with our samples?\" turned out to be fundamentally the same question researchers ask across medicine, psychology, agriculture, and countless other fields.</p>\n<p>Here's where the story gets delightfully peculiar: Guinness had prohibited employees from publishing research after a previous incident involving trade secrets. So Gosset published his groundbreaking 1908 paper under the pseudonym \"Student\" to avoid detection by his employer. This is why statistics textbooks still refer to \"Student's t-test\" rather than the Gosset t-test, a quirk of corporate secrecy that accidentally erased his name from his own achievement.</p>\n<p>The plaque, visible during Guinness Storehouse tours, recognizes this unlikely hero of modern science. Beneath his name and dates (1876–1937) appears his title \"Chief Brewer\" alongside \"Student 't' test\" a perfect encapsulation of how the pursuit of the perfect pint accidentally gave the world one of its most essential analytical tools. Brewers demand consistency while vintners celebrate variation, and in this case, that obsession with uniformity inspired genuine innovation.</p>\n<p>Gosset remained at Guinness throughout his career, eventually building a small statistics department and corresponding with luminaries like Ronald Fisher and Karl Pearson. He never sought fame for his discovery, content in the knowledge that he had solved real problems for his brewery while quietly revolutionizing how scientists everywhere interpret their data.</p>",

When you are put on the spot, and the adrenaline/heart rate/cortisol starts pumping, no resources go towards the part of your brain that helps you think clearly (prefrontal cortex).

And for that Giang suggested using the PREP (point, reason example, point) framework, which is as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Point:</strong> One main or opinion that kicks things off. </li><li><strong>Reason:</strong> Just one explanation as to why you hold that point or believe it is true, using justifications and evidence. </li><li><strong>Example:</strong> Data, a story, or concrete illustration to support your reasoning and make your point more persuasive. </li><li><strong>Point:</strong> Reiterating your original main point to reinforce your message and provide a strong conclusion.</li></ul><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">- YouTube</small>        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">                <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPoPGfoaoZo\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com</a>        </small>        </p><p>Not only this, but giving yourself a second to pause, breathe, and take in the question, repeating or reframing the question to yourself, and slowing down your speech as you answer can be incredibly helpful in clear, concise communication. </p><p>At the end of the day, blanking out doesn’t mean you’re unprepared or incapable. It's a sign your brain is working overtime. The good news is you only need a few simple adjustments to turn those high-pressure moments into opportunities for clarity.</p>",

From fragile, untouched ecosystems to familiar but unexplained occurrences in our own backyards, Untold Earth chases insight into natural phenomena through the voices of those who know them best.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Lucy Greeley: </strong>The closest thing I can think to imagining bioluminescence without it being bioluminescence are the stars. It's magical that in the sky you can see all these stars and then in the water you can see all these stars. I think that's what makes it so captivating for a lot of people.</p>\n<p><strong>Narrator: </strong>From Aristotle to Darwin, humankind's efforts to understand bioluminescence spans thousands of years. But even though it's one of the oldest fields of scientific study, the answers remain elusive. What is it about this inscrutable mystery that inspires such obsession?</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/106100/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p><strong>Rob Purser: </strong>Well, the history of Suquamish Tribe, we've been here for thousands of years. We had villages all through this immediate area over in the Hood Canal and on the Bremerton and all over Kitsap Peninsula.</p>\n<p><strong>Lucy: </strong>There isn't really that much known about bioluminescence in the Salish Sea. I think that's what makes it really special is a lot of people think about bioluminescence in these tropical regions, but we have it right up here in this very diverse and rich environment.</p>\n<p>I grew up in Seattle, Washington. I didn't really know that much about it. I went to one sleepaway camp and I remember getting woken up in the middle of the night. The counselors all pulled us campers down to the shore and started swimming in it. And we were like, what? That's crazy. And then I learned about this internship and I was like, that is perfect.</p>\n<p>So bioluminescence is a chemical reaction that occurs in a living organism in an oxygenated environment. If we think about plankton in general as a lot of tiny, really tiny microscopic free-floating organisms, within that there are a group of plankton called algae.</p>\n<p>Microscopic algae are split up into two different sectors, one of which is diatoms and then the other are dinoflagellates. And what I'm interested are dinoflagellates because some of these dinoflagellates are bioluminescent.</p>\n<p><strong>Carrley Smith: </strong>My name is Carrley. I've been guiding here. We're working here for about a month. And the cool thing about tonight and for the bioluminescence tours is we have Lucy here.</p>\n<p>I'm taking over her internship this summer with the hopes to keep doing it every summer so someone can come and keep following up on the research.</p>\n<p>We'll paddle out of the bay here. And then there's a cool little lagoon that we're going to go into. All right, Crystal, your rudder's coming down. You have steering. We'll see you out there.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/106096/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p>So they're not going to start bioluminescing until they know it's nighttime now. So the ones that we're seeing now are just the early risers. They just have their cup of coffee. They're just coming out. If we were out here at 2 a.m., more of them would be bioluminescing because they know it's nighttime because it's so energetically costly for them.</p>\n<p>They save it for when it's going to be good. Go paddle around. Some patches will be better than others. But play around, figure out a way that is really cool to see them and let us know. It's beautiful. Sparkle, sparkle.</p>\n<p>I don't think you can feel them, but it almost feels like you can. It makes it truly magic seeing it on your skin, on your fingers. It's so cool.</p>\n<p><strong>Lucy</strong>: We take samples as we're doing those tours and guiding people, and then we get to go back and do some lab work on it. The fun part about this research is sometimes it means that Carrley and I become a little nocturnal because we are trying to process some of these samples right as we get back.</p>\n<p>I was trying to identify some dinoflagellates that were present during the bioluminescent events and who could maybe be participating in that... Seems like more diatoms. That could be some sort of algae.</p>\n<p>And I found four known bioluminescent species that were in all my samples. There's research done that in the deep sea ocean where light can't penetrate, 90% of organisms can emit bioluminescence.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/106104/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p>There's such a common form of communication among this species and on this earth and that it's just something that's so hard for humans to study that we haven't thought that much about. That is exciting and that's fun to see and I think that that might even be one right next to it right there.</p>\n<p>Either one of them could be emitting bioluminescence. It's so fascinating how all of them are single-celled organisms. They don't seem like they're multifaceted and they don't seem like they're complicated, but yet they create this thing that's so special to see.</p>\n<p><strong>Dave Sigo: </strong>Fishing on the Salish Sea? Well, I love every part of it.</p>\n<p>It's our right. It's what we do. for our people. My grandfather, he traveled all over harvesting salmon, and my dad too. Trying to teach the youth how to carry on what we're doing here and preserve it. I know what's around here. You know, it's hard to catch salmon when that stuff lights up your neck because it's just like a big flashlight down there. I mean, a big wall of lights is what it looks like. And I always wondered what that stuff was about.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/106102/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p><strong>Lucy: </strong>Bioluminescent algae that we're concerned with, we're still kind of figuring out why they might be using it. The first of which is maybe that it's scaring or stunning a predator, the second that maybe it's attracting a secondary predator, and so then something eats the predator going after those bioluminescent algae.</p>\n<p>There's definitely an evolutionary advantage to it because so many different things have evolved the ability. These bioluminescent algae are very much at the bottom of the food chain and then that in turn can serve to produce a lot of oxygen in our environments. Little small fish will eat plankton and then bigger fish like salmon can eat those smaller fish and all the way up into marine mammals such as seals and our orcas.</p>\n<p>It's all interconnected and it's a really special environment. In the Salish Sea region, we don't actually know a lot about how these bioluminescent algae could be affecting the health of this ecosystem. And so I think that that's really important about what Carrley and I's research is tackling in that we are trying to answer these more basic questions that can hopefully provide an answer about whether more abundant bioluminescent algae is good or bad for this ecosystem, or whether or not it doesn't have an influence, or maybe it's just about having the right balance of these species.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/106103/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p>I think what drives me is the mystery of a lot of it. You can put on your goggles and your snorkel and swim in it and it's right in front of your eyes and it's so special to have something magical like that that you can really interact with. I think it plays into that same kind of childlike, explorative behavior in me.</p>\n<p>It's lovely.</p>",

Go easy on the industrial activities and vehicular emissions:</span><span><br /></span><span></span></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Vehicular emissions from petrol and diesel, along with industrial activities and port operations, result in elevated levels of PM2.5, with frequent daily averages exceeding 50&nbsp;</span><span>micrograms per cubic metre </span><span>according to Deccan Herald&rsquo;s report in January 2025.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Minimising the excessive use of diesel generators, we can cut localised emissions of soot, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter, helping improve air quality and reduce the overall pollution load in the city.</span></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>3. Plant local greens:</span><span><br /></span><span></span></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Native species like neem, ficus, and jamun can absorb 10&ndash;15 micrograms per cubic metre of PM2.5 per square metre of leaf area. Even <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/134668/maharashtra-plastic-ban/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">balcony plants</a> make a measurable difference in micro-environments.</span></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>4. Celebrate consciously:</span><span><br /></span><span></span></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Firecrackers give a sharp, short-term boost to PM 2.5 &mdash; in Mumbai, recent reports showed citywide PM 2.5 rose by roughly 30 &ndash; 40% on Diwali nights.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>With strict enforcement, designated bursting zones and public awareness, short-term festival peaks in PM2.5 levels could plausibly be reduced, and there can be brighter and healthier celebrations.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>These small actions that we take together can lead to big changes.

In Valley of Fire, just an hour outside Las Vegas, inky black skies are interrupted only by awe-inspiring rock formations. And Great Basin National Park, located near the Utah border, is internationally renowned for its designation as a dark sky park.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re an astronomy enthusiast or just a night owl who doesn’t know your Merak from your Mizar (those are stars in the Big Dipper, FYI), settle into one of these spots to open your mind to the vast expanse of the universe. Head to these parks for their unmatched stars, and stay for the surrounding adventures—from hiking to camping to wildlife viewing.</p>\n<h2 class=\"article-subheading-pre-rd\">Valley of Fire State Park</h2>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/106039/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/106038/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p>Nevada’s oldest state park is a sprawling nature preservation area known for its dramatic, red sandstone formations, which look as though they’re on fire when reflecting the sun’s rays. Valley of Fire is 40 miles (about an hour’s drive) outside of Las Vegas, meaning it is unaffected by the city’s neon lights.</p>\n<p>The park is open from sunrise to sunset unless you’re camping in the designated campgrounds at Atlatl Rock or Arch Rock. It isn’t unusual to spot the Milky Way with the naked eye on clear nights (especially on or around the New Moon). The park often hosts professional astronomers, allowing visitors to view constellations and planets through telescopes and hear the stories associated with different celestial bodies. Guests can also embark on self-guided moonlit hikes from September to May when the weather is mild and the stars are at their brightest. But no matter what time of year you explore the valley, sitting among ancient rock formations in total darkness is a truly magical experience.</p>\n<p>Once home to the Ancestral Pueblo farmers, the valley is now a hot spot for camping and hiking, with popular trails including the Fire Wave and the Rainbow Vista. The petroglyphs of the park’s ancient inhabitants can be discovered amongst petrified trees and eroded rocks with unique shapes and textures (one even looks like a giant elephant!). After dark, the valley inspires wonder in a completely different way. A number of nocturnal animals—from lizards to bobcats to ground squirrels—come out to play, and the sky lights up with thousands of stars.</p>\n<h2 class=\"article-subheading-pre-rd\">Great Basin National Park</h2>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/106045/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/106044/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p>Recognized as an “International Dark Sky Park” by Dark Sky International, Great Basin is one of the world’s best spots to stargaze. Due to its high desert setting, the air in the park contains little view-blocking moisture, making it easier to view constellations with the naked eye. During the summer (peak stargazing season) the skies above Great Basin reveal over 6,000 stars and glimpses into the Andromeda and Triangulum galaxies.</p>\n<p>This sprawling, 77-thousand-acre park contains wonder at every turn, from groves of ancient bristlecone pines—among the oldest living trees on Earth—to ethereal stalactites and stalagmites inside the Lehman Caves. The difference between the park’s highest and lowest trails is over 6,000 feet, from the top of Wheeler Peak to the bottom of Mountain View Trail. But no matter where you are in Great Basin, you’re in for some amazing nighttime views.</p>\n<p>The park notes that it is committed to reducing its light pollution footprint, employing red exterior lights instead of white and even measuring the brightness of the night sky every month. This careful monitoring ensures that no outside light encroaches on the park’s pristine darkness. Also, between Memorial Day and Labor Day, Great Basin Astronomy rangers lead programs at the Astronomy Amphitheater every Thursday through Sunday.</p>\n<h2 class=\"article-subheading-pre-rd\">Black Rock Desert</h2>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/106046/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/106043/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p>This rugged landscape in northwest Nevada is the largest collection of publicly managed land in the continental U.S. Once home to Lake Lahontan, a massive inland sea from the last ice age, the area is now known for its Black Rock Playa—a flat, dry expanse that stretches over 200 square miles (and is famous for being the annual site of Burning Man).</p>\n<p>Most Black Rock campers stay in the center of the playa, where miles lie between your vantage point and the nearest mountain ranges. Black Rock Desert is known for its meteor showers—most notably the Perseid Meteor Shower, which bursts through the serene night skies each August. During Perseid, Friends of Black Rock-High Rock hosts a meteor shower campout, where amateur astronomers can view the phenomenon through telescopes (and drink some complementary hot chocolate!). Rocket enthusiasts, too, make regular trips to the playa to conduct breathtaking night launches that shine against the desert’s wide, flat terrain.</p>\n<p>Driving through Black Rock, adventurers can also spot volcanic rock formations, fossilized, prehistoric remains, and native wildlife like mule deer and horned lizards. If you choose to stay the night and pitch your tent in the desert, you’re in for a whole other set of natural wonders.</p>\n<h2 class=\"article-subheading-pre-rd\">Walker River State Recreation Area</h2>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/106042/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/106041/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p>In 2017, the Walker Basin Conservancy donated over 12,000 acres of land to the State of Nevada, including several large ranches that had been closed to the public for over a hundred years. Today, the ranches and surrounding land compose the five distinct park units of Walker River State Recreation Area.</p>\n<p>Nine Mile Ranch, also known as the “Elbow,” is the least developed of Walker River’s five parks and still looks just like the large ranch area that it was a century ago. Visitors can camp out in the Elbow’s Bighorn Campground, where there is easy access to the river and—more importantly—the darkest, most astonishing skies in the whole recreation area. Occasionally, Walker River park rangers host on-site astronomy nights, where visitors can experiment with different telescopic equipment and learn more about the numerous planets viewable from the park.</p>\n<p>The East Walker River runs through this rolling landscape, with designated access points for kayakers, floaters, and fishers, and the area’s winding dirt roads are popular with hikers, mountain bikers, and equestrians. While Walker River is a popular site for daytime treks and picnics, it’s also an incredible place to spend the night. Whether you choose to pitch a tent, hook up your RV, or rent one of the campgrounds’ riverside cabins, there’s a whole new world to explore when the sun sets over Walker River.</p>\n<h2 class=\"article-subheading-pre-rd\">Lunar Crater</h2>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/106040/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/106047/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<p>Recognized as one of Nevada’s six National Natural Landmarks, the Lunar Crater volcanic field is one of the state’s most remarkable, otherworldly features, containing a whopping, 400-acre crater thought to have been formed by several shallow volcanic eruptions. Lunar Crater and its surrounding, smaller craters are so much like the landscape of the moon that the area was classified as an official “Terrestrial Analogue Site” and used for NASA’s Apollo astronaut training during the 1970s.</p>\n<p>While its space-training days may be over, Lunar Crater is still an unbeatable spot for taking in the night sky. Explorers of the crater can camp anywhere along the pull-offs of the Backcountry Byway, all of which offer unobstructed views of the inky black sky and, often, a look at the Milky Way. The crater is a great place to experience zodiacal light—the sunlight that reflects off dust in the sun’s orbit path and produces a faint, pyramid-shaped glow in the night sky. Stargazers at Lunar Crater can also witness an astonishing red and green airglow across the sky and even get glimpses of the Dark Horse Nebula in the Milky Way’s Great Rift.</p>\n<p>The Lunar Crater Backcountry Byway passes by the crater with a stopping point where visitors can get out of their cars for a closer look. Along the bumpy dirt road, it’s easy to spot natural formations like cinder cones and basalt flows, as well as some lovely wildflowers. The Byway also takes you past 20 different extinct volcanoes and ancient, obsidian-covered lava beds.</p>",

But her extraordinary achievements leave a profound legacy.</p>\n<figure>\n            <p>\n                    <img alt=\"Jane-goodall-chimp_2025-10-02.jpg\" src=\"https://www.earthtouchnews.com/media/1955766/jane-goodall-chimp_2025-10-02.jpg?mode=crop&amp;width=1060&amp;height=707\" />\n                <br /><figcaption>Image © Penelope Breese/Getty</figcaption>\n            </p>\n        </figure>\n<p>Goodall was a world-leading expert in animal behaviour and a globally recognised environmental and conservation advocate. She achieved all this at a time when women were commonly sidelined or ignored in science.</p>\n<p>Her work with chimpanzees showed it was wrong to assume only humans used tools. She showed us the animals expressed emotions such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQNmOYydlKE\">love and grief</a> and have individual personalities.</p>\n<p>Goodall showed us scientists <em>can</em> express their emotions and values and that we <em>can</em> be respected researchers as well as passionate advocates and science communicators. After learning about how chimpanzees were being used in medical research, she <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/business/jane-goodall-corner-office.html\">spoke out</a>: “I went to the conference as a scientist, and I left as an activist.”</p>\n<p>As childhood rights activist Marian Wright Edelman has eloquently <a href=\"https://unitar.org/about/news-stories/stories/you-cant-be-what-you-cant-see\">put it</a>, “You can’t be what you can’t see”.</p>\n<p>Goodall showed what it was possible to be.</p>\n<h6>Forging her own path</h6>\n<p>Goodall took a nontraditional path into science. The brave step of going into the field at <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-10-02/primatologist-jane-goodall-obituary/102197696\">the age of 26</a> to make observations was supported by her mother.</p>\n<p>Despite making world-first discoveries such as tool use by non-humans, people didn’t take her seriously because she hadn’t yet <a href=\"https://time.com/3949985/jane-goodall-college-history/\">gone to university</a>. Nowadays, people who contribute wildlife observations are celebrated under the banner of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/social-media-footage-reveals-little-known-surfing-whales-in-australian-waters-241347\">citizen science</a>.</p>\n<p>Goodall was a beacon at a time when science was largely dominated by men – especially remote fieldwork. But she changed that narrative. She convinced famous paleoanthropologist <a href=\"https://leakeyfoundation.org/about-us/the-leakey-family/\">Louis Leakey</a> to give her a chance. He first employed her as a secretary. But it wasn’t long until he asked her <a href=\"https://janegoodall.global/rememberingjane/\">to go to Tanzania’s remote Gombe Stream National Park</a>. In 1960, she arrived.</p>\n<p>This was not easy. It took real courage to work in a remote area with limited support alongside chimpanzees, a species thought to be peaceful but now known to be far stronger than humans and capable of killing animals and humans.</p>\n<p>Goodall is believed to be the only person <a href=\"https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/jane-goodall/\">accepted into chimpanzee society</a>. Through <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2025/10/jane-goodall-1934-2025-primatologist-conservationist-and-messenger-of-hope/\">calm but determined persistence</a> she won their trust. These qualities served Goodall well – not just with chimps, but throughout her entire career advocating for conservation and societal change.</p>\n<p>At Gombe, she showed for the first time that animals could fashion and use tools, had individual personalities, expressed emotions and had a <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/jane-goodall-conservationist-who-transformed-our-understanding-of/\">higher intelligence and understanding</a> than they were credited with.</p>\n<div class=\"videoWrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; margin: 20px 0;\">\n        <!-- Copy & Pasted from YouTube -->\n        \n    </div>\n<p>Goodall was always an animal person and her love of chimps was in part inspired by her toy Jubilee, gifted by her father. She had close bonds with her pets and extended these bonds to wildlife. Goodall gave her study subjects names such as “<a href=\"https://www.news.janegoodall.org/2015/09/29/the-famous-chimps-of-gombe/2/\">David Greybeard</a>”, the first chimp to accept her at Gombe.</p>\n<p>Some argue we shouldn’t place a <a href=\"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pan3.10503\">human persona on animals</a> by naming them. But Goodall showed it was not only acceptable to see animals as individuals with different behaviours, but it greatly aids connection with and care for wildlife.</p>\n<p>Goodall became an international voice for wildlife. She used her profile to encourage a focus on animal welfare in conservation, caring for both individuals and species.  </p>\n<figure>\n            <p>\n                    <img alt=\"Jane-goodall-baby-chimp_2025-10-02.jpg\" src=\"https://www.earthtouchnews.com/media/1955764/jane-goodall-baby-chimp_2025-10-02.jpg?mode=crop&amp;width=1060&amp;height=707\" />\n                <br /><figcaption>Jane Goodall’s pioneering work with chimpanzees shed light on these animals as individuals – and showed they make tools and experience emotions.

The other two are the naturalist documentary maker, Sir David Attenborough, 99, and famed marine biologist Dr Sylvia Earle, who is 90.</p>\n<p>Goodall showed us women can be pioneering scientists and renowned communicators as well as mothers.</p>\n<p>She shared her work in ways accessible to all generations, from National Geographic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3b6zSpy7P4\">documentaries</a> to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4cGn-gm4MTI?si=mMQp_Asv1ggTYM27\">hip podcasts</a>.</p>\n<p>Her visibility encouraged girls and women around the world to be bold and follow our own paths.  </p>\n<p>Goodall’s story directly inspired several authors of this article.</p>\n<p>Co-author Marissa Parrott was privileged to have spoken to Goodall several times during her <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/protect-primates-to-salve-planet-urges-jane-goodall-20110609-1fuwp.html\">visits</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcMcGDgrA74\">Melbourne Zoo</a> and on her world tours. Goodall’s story was a direct inspiration for Parrott’s own remote and international fieldwork, supported by her mother just as Goodall’s mother had <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-10-02/primatologist-jane-goodall-obituary/102197696\">supported her</a>. They both survived <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-catching-malaria-gave-me-a-new-perspective-on-saving-gorillas-103911\">malaria</a>, which also kills chimpanzees and gorillas. Goodall long championed a <a href=\"https://news.janegoodall.org/2021/02/23/zoonotic-disease-one-health-and-jgi-everything-is-connected/\">One Health</a> approach, recognising the health of communities, wildlife and the environment are all interconnected.</p>\n<p>Co-author Zara Bending worked and toured alongside Goodall. The experience demonstrated how conservationists could be powerful advocates through storytelling, and how our actions reveal who we are. As Goodall once said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>every single one of us matters, every single one of us has a role to play, and every single one of us makes a difference every single day.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h6>From the forest floor to global icon</h6>\n<p>Goodall knew conservation is as much about people as it is about wildlife and wild places.</p>\n<p>Seventeen years after beginning her groundbreaking research in Gombe, Goodall established the <a href=\"https://janegoodall.global/\">Jane Goodall Institute</a> with the mission of protecting wildlife and habitat by engaging local communities.</p>\n<p>Her institute’s <a href=\"https://janegoodall.global/\">global network</a> now spans five continents and continues her legacy of <a href=\"https://www.esri.com/about/newsroom/blog/goodall-tacare-human-wildlife-relationship\">community-centred conservation</a>. Researchers have now been studying the chimps at Gombe for <a href=\"https://news.janegoodall.org/2025/07/08/gombe-chimpanzee-research-65-year/\">65 years</a>.</p>\n<p>Goodall moved from fieldwork to being a global conservation icon who regularly travelled more than 300 days a year. She observed many young people across cultures and creeds who had lost hope for their future amid environmental and climate destruction. In response, she founded a second organisation, <a href=\"https://rootsandshoots.global/\">Roots &amp; Shoots</a>, in 1991. Her goal was:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>to foster respect and compassion for all living things, to promote understanding of all cultures and beliefs, and to inspire each individual to take action to make the world a better place for people, other animals, and the environment.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Last year, Roots &amp; Shoots groups were active in 75 countries. Their work is a testament to Goodall’s mantra: find hope in action.</p>\n<figure>\n            <p>\n                    <img alt=\"Jane-goodall-speaking_2025-10-02.jpg\" src=\"https://www.earthtouchnews.com/media/1955765/jane-goodall-speaking_2025-10-02.jpg?mode=crop&amp;width=1060&amp;height=707\" />\n                <br /><figcaption>Jane Goodall went from pioneering field researcher to international conservation icon.

Holloway/Getty</a></figcaption>\n            </p>\n        </figure>\n<h6>Protecting nature close to home</h6>\n<p>One of Goodall’s most remarkable attributes was her drive to give people the power to take action where they were. No matter where people lived or what they did, she helped them realise they could be part of the solution.</p>\n<p>In a busy, urbanised world, it’s easier than ever to feel disconnected from nature. Rather than presenting nature as a distant concept, Goodall made it something for everyone to experience, care for and cherish.</p>\n<p>She showed we didn’t have to leave our normal lives behind to protect nature – we could make just as much difference in our own communities.</p>\n<p>One of her most famous quotes rings just as true today as when she first said it:  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>only if we understand, can we care. Only if we care, will we help. Only if we help shall all be saved.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let’s honour her world-changing legacy by committing to understand, care and help save all species with whom we share this world.

In fact, our new study, <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1007/s44338-025-00099-2\">published today</a> in Discover Animals, shows interspecies interactions between dolphins and whales are widespread and frequent around the world.</p>\n<figure>\n            <p>\n                    <img alt=\"whale-swimming_2025-08-21.jpg\" src=\"https://www.earthtouchnews.com/media/1955741/whale-swimming_2025-08-21.jpg?mode=crop&amp;width=1060&amp;height=707\" />\n                <br /><figcaption>Image © drewsulockcreations/Getty</figcaption>\n            </p>\n        </figure>\n<h6>An astonishing interaction</h6>\n<p>There have been several reports of whale and dolphin interaction in the past.</p>\n<p>One that astonished the public back in 2004 featured a humpback whale in Hawaii repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC3AkGSigrA\">lifting a bottlenose dolphin on its head</a>.</p>\n<p>Researchers suggested <a href=\"https://www.aquaticmammalsjournal.org/article/vol-36-iss-2-deakos-et-al/\">such close contact between whales and dolphins</a> is likely very rare – and maybe related to care giving.</p>\n<p>But other forms of interactions resembling joint feeding, play and harassment are now being frequently documented thanks to drone technology. Many are also featured on social media.</p>\n<div class=\"videoWrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; margin: 20px 0;\">\n        <!-- Copy & Pasted from YouTube -->\n        \n    </div>\n<h6>A ‘whale’s-eye view’ of the world</h6>\n<p>For our new study, we undertook an analysis of 199 independent whale-dolphin interaction events involving 19 different species. These interactions spanned two decades and occurred across 17 countries.</p>\n<p>We drew from social media platforms – such as Facebook, YouTube and Instagram – and footage contributed by citizens to get a variety of observations.</p>\n<p>Each entry was carefully reviewed to identify the species involved, validate the interaction and categorise behaviours. Two additional cases came from camera tags attached to humpback whales. These offered an underwater “whale’s-eye view” of their encounters with dolphins.</p>\n<p>We categorised behaviours such as rolling, tail slaps, bow riding, and rubbing, and classified dolphin positions relative to whale body parts such as head, flank and tail fluke.</p>\n<h6>Having fun or fighting?</h6>\n<p>The study contradicted earlier assumptions that interspecies interactions between dolphins and whales are very rare.</p>\n<p>The most common interaction was dolphins swimming near the whale’s head (akin to bow riding). This accounted for 80% of observed dolphin positions. Humpback whales were the most involved whale species, while bottlenose dolphins led the dolphin side.</p>\n<p>Based on videos we analysed, dolphins initiated most interactions through bow riding, swimming in formation, or even touching whales.</p>\n<p>In more than one-quarter of the events, the whales responded in seemingly similar ways. For example, humpback whales often rolled, exposed their bellies, or gently turned toward dolphins.</p>\n<p>Tail slaps and other signs of distress or aggression were rare (roughly 5% of cases).</p>\n<p>As a result of this, we classified more than one-third of all interactions between humpback whales and dolphins as positive or possible social play.</p>\n<p>The two camera-tag videos revealed previously undocumented interaction. Dolphins were observed following humpback whales not only at the surface but down to the ocean floor. They maintained eye contact or even touched the whales’ head – suggesting intentional, possibly social, engagement.</p>\n<div class=\"videoWrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; margin: 20px 0;\">\n        <!-- Copy & Pasted from YouTube -->\n        \n    </div>\n<h6>Reflecting advanced emotional capabilities</h6>\n<p>The findings reshape our understanding of how social marine mammals interact across species. They suggest interspecies interaction among marine mammals may be far more prevalent and complex than previously believed.</p>\n<p>Dolphins may seek out whales as companions for stimulation, play or even courtship-like behaviour. Meanwhile, certain whale species, particularly humpback whales, may not only tolerate but also engage with dolphins in a social capacity.</p>\n<p>This interspecies dynamic adds a new dimension to marine mammal social ecology and could point to cultural elements in whale and dolphin societies. The playfulness, cooperation and apparent enjoyment observed in many interactions reflect advanced cognitive and emotional capabilities.</p>\n<p>The study also demonstrates the power of new technologies and community science. Social media and drones proved invaluable for collecting a range of diverse behavioural data that traditional surveys might miss.</p>\n<p>Social media data has limitations, such as geographic and observer bias caused by different angles, heights, equipment and frequency of use of social media. But it does complement other data and helps uncover previously unknown behaviours.</p>\n<p>Whales and dolphins don’t just coexist but also seek each other out. Future studies incorporating acoustic recordings and longer observation periods could further unravel the motivations and meanings behind these fascinating encounters.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

It is the <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/gardening/autumn-gardening-tips-for-spring-garden-care-guide-for-healthy-bloom-takeaway-tricks-10553164\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">season of renewal</a>, when the soil, still warm beneath gentle skies, becomes a canvas for cool-weather crops. Among the most rewarding to sow now are peas and beans.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They are unassuming little seeds that promise abundance, nourishment and a touch of rustic elegance to any garden. Brimming with natural protein and dynamism, these verdant climbers are as pleasing to the eye as they are to the palate.</p>\n<h2>The charm of Autumn sowing</h2>\n<p>Autumn&rsquo;s mild climate and softened sunlight create the ideal conditions for peas and beans. The soil remains pliant and rich from the monsoon&rsquo;s generosity, while cooler days favour strong and steady growth. This balance of warmth and freshness helps seeds germinate swiftly and plants flourish without the stress of scorching heat.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Choose your varieties wisely</h3>\n<p>The secret to a flourishing crop lies in the seed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Peas: Choose quick-growing types such as garden peas, snow peas or sugar snaps. These survive in temperate weather and offer a sweet and tender yield.</li>\n<li>Beans: Opt for French beans if you prefer compact bushes, or runner beans if you fancy elegant climbers that drape beautifully along a trellis.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Sowing peas and beans\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/sowing-peas-and-beans-2025-10-28-18-31-12.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Autumn&rsquo;s mild climate and softened sunlight create the ideal conditions for peas and beans.

Peas and beans prosper in friable, <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/446695/grow-amla-in-pots-container-gardening-indian-gooseberry-gardening-steps-grow-in-compact-spaces/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fertile soil with excellent drainage</a>. Loosen the soil to a depth of about 20 to 25 centimetres and blend in generous amounts of compost or well-rotted manure. Though legumes enrich the earth by fixing nitrogen, they still appreciate a nutrient-rich start.</p>\n<p>Avoid recently used plots where other legumes grew; the soil may harbour pests or depleted elements that could stunt new plants.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Sow with care</h3>\n<p>Sow once the harsh sun has mellowed and the soil feels comfortably warm to the touch.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Peas: Plant seeds two to three centimetres deep, leaving about five centimetres between each.</li>\n<li>Beans: Set them slightly deeper, around three to four centimetres, with 15 to 20 centimetres between plants and roughly half a metre between rows.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your soil tends to retain water, create raised beds to keep the roots from drowning. A moist, not soggy, surface is ideal for germination.</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Sowing peas and beans\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/sowing-peas-and-beans-2025-10-28-18-36-28.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Choose quick-growing types such as garden peas, snow peas, or sugar snaps for better yield.

Bamboo poles, garden netting or wooden frames make excellent supports. Setting these up at the time of sowing <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/466731/monsoon-gardening-tips-india-rainy-season-vegetable-garden-care-how-to-take-care-of-plants/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">prevents damage to tender roots</a> later. Bush beans, by contrast, remain neat and upright, needing no assistance beyond good spacing.</p>\n<h3>Step 5: Water thoughtfully</h3>\n<p>Consistency in watering is crucial. Keep the soil evenly moist, especially during flowering and pod formation. Water early in the morning to allow leaves to dry through the day, reducing the risk of fungal disease. A mulch of straw or dry leaves will conserve moisture and suppress unwelcome weeds.</p>\n<h3>Step 6: Feed and protect</h3>\n<p>Although peas and beans are self-reliant, a mild organic feed at the onset of flowering can enhance their yield. Watch for aphids or leaf miners; a natural neem spray or gentle soap solution will deter them effectively. <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/429250/grow-lychee-at-home-indian-cities-home-gardening-steps-climate-soil-lychee-cultivation/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Good airflow and sunlight</a> are the simplest guardians against most ailments.</p>\n<h3>Step 7: Harvest at their prime</h3>\n<p>The joy of harvesting lies in timing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Peas: Pick when pods are plump yet tender, before the seeds harden.</li>\n<li>Beans: Gather when they are slender and firm but still supple to the touch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Harvest regularly because the more you pick, the more the plant produces.</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Sowing peas and beans\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/sowing-peas-and-beans-2025-10-28-18-39-55.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Peas and beans prosper in friable, fertile soil with excellent drainage.

Their roots hold nitrogen that <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/490257/scientist-shitarashmi-sahu-transforms-rourkela-steel-industry-slag-waste-into-fertiliser/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">enriches the soil</a> naturally. Turn the remaining foliage into compost or gently mix it into the bed to prepare for your next planting.</p>\n<h2>Essential takeaways for a flourishing autumn garden</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Start early:</strong> Sow as soon as the days begin to cool.</li>\n<li><strong>Seek sunlight:</strong> Peas and beans need at least five hours of direct light each day.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep soil moist:</strong> Never let it dry out completely.</li>\n<li><strong>Support climbers:</strong> A trellis or pole structure supports healthy growth.</li>\n<li><strong>Feed organically:</strong> <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/sustainability/puja-waste-at-home-easy-tips-to-turn-flowers-leftover-food-into-compost-for-home-garden-10502428\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rely on compost</a> rather than chemical fertilisers.</li>\n<li><strong>Harvest often:</strong> Regular picking promotes steady production.</li>\n</ul>",

Most of us have things we'd prefer our fellow passengers do or not do to make the experience better for everyone, however, so <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1281927547301567&amp;id=100064530016648&amp;mibextid=wwXIfr&amp;rdid=VREg45wZSqLfHoZB\" target=\"_blank\">we asked our <em>Upworthy</em> Facebook audience</a>, \"If you could enforce one social rule during flights, what would it be?\" The responses were largely what you might expect and you can see them below, but there was one unexpected comment that stood out. The rule that received the most love, with over 1,200 likes, was this one: </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"dog, flying, airplane, good dog, golden retriever\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"617a0\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk3NjQ2My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NzY0ODQ1Nn0.y0B1z1rARbk1GCb06LtNFBqa250MLDnGPuCRJqJwe_U/img.jpg?width=980\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Can we please get a \"meet the dog\" rule on airplanes?</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos\" target=\"_blank\">Photo credit: Canva</a></small></p><h2>Any dog on the plane has to visit every passenger that requests </h2><p>While not everyone loves dogs, <a href=\"https://www.dvm360.com/view/dogs-rule-cats-drool-americans-prefer-pups\" target=\"_blank\">most people do</a>. And what would make a flight more enjoyable than getting to meet a dog on board? Perhaps we can start a petition to make cabin doggy visits for anyone who wants them an official thing…</p><p>Other responses were helpful reminders of both common courtesy and somewhat standard airplane etiquette for those who might not fly often enough to be familiar with it. In addition to the \"meet the dog\" rule, here are 10 more social rules people wish they could enforce on flights:</p><h4>Be nice to flight attendants</h4><p>Imagine being responsible for both the comfort and safety of 100+ people from different places with different needs in a cabin hurtling through the sky 30,000 feet above the Earth. Flight attendants deal with a wide array of people day in and day out, and we should all make sure we treat them with the kindness and respect that they deserve. </p><h4>Middle seat gets the armrests</h4><p>Nobody should be hogging the armrests, but if anyone has a right to them, it's the sacrificial soul who has to sit in the middle seat. (And window seat controls the window, in case that's not common sense.)</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"headphones, flight, courtesy, airplane etiquette, flying\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"012bd\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk3NjQ4My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgyMjAxOTE5Mn0.qoG3wc4EmWTH6EpUuxgzdiDzXYv99M3sbtOybEIyQpc/img.jpg?width=980\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">No matter your age, headphones to listen to things on a flight are a must.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos\" target=\"_blank\">Photo credit: Canva</a></small></p><h4>Headphones, please</h4><p>No one wants to listen to your video but you. Imagine if everyone listened to movies or YouTube videos or whatever without headphones—total social chaos. In public and on planes, use headphones to listen or watch something. </p><h4>No 'manspreading'</h4><p>We all know the legroom on flights has become practically non-existent, and for people with long legs it can be hard to not bang your knees up against the seat in front of you. But spreading your legs apart so wide that it infringes on other people's leg space just isn't cool. We're all in the same boat, so we have to respect one another's space. </p><h4>Keep your shoes and socks on</h4><p>There may be an exception here for long-haul flights as long as you keep your socks on and don't have stinky feet, but bringing a pair of slippers or something is still courteous. But definitely keep your socks on and be aware that you might not be able to tell if your own feet smell. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"flying, flights, airplane, overhead bin, flight etiquette\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c84ee\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk3NjQ2Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgxNzI1NzQzMn0.nTn3Czb7_SbY_y6zHf4yFP6BlMa7DgwMTZXh_MAZCaQ/img.jpg?width=980\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">One overhead bag per passenger until everyone's got their luggage settled. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos\" target=\"_blank\">Photo credit: Canva</a></small></p><h4>Don’t put a second bag or a jacket in the overhead bin until everyone has put their first bag in</h4><p>Overhead space is limited, so wait until everyone has had a chance to get their carry-on into that space before adding more than your one bag to it. Once everyone's settled in, feel free to add whatever overflow you have.</p><h4>Try not to fart</h4><p>We've all been on a flight where someone let one rip and made everyone's eyes water. Unless you have zero choice in the matter, refrain from dropping gas bombs on your fellow passengers. We're all human and humans fart, but an airplane cabin is a tight spot where people can't get away. At least take it to the lavatory if you can. </p><h4>Be aware of smells in general</h4><p>Come clean and fresh, but not perfumed. Deodorant? Yes, please. Strong cologne or perfume? No. Food that emits a strong odor? Also no. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"flight attendant, safety presentation, airplane safety, seatbelts, courtesy\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"30dc0\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk3NjQ2OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3OTIwNDgwNn0.xBtuHuZWf1wCwitAEzDVcYlFP8MM5Hd8zwv-TYasUTo/img.jpg?width=980\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Even if you know it by heart, please don't talk during the safety demonstration.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos\" target=\"_blank\">Photo credit: Canva</a></small></p><h4>Stay quiet during the safety demonstration</h4><p>Some people fly all the time and could recite the safety demonstration spiel by heart, but that doesn't mean everyone is familiar with it. It only takes a few minutes and first-time flyers need to hear it. It's respectful to the flight attendants to not talk through their presentation and courteous to other passengers who need to listen. </p><h4>Remain seated until it’s your row’s turn to deplane</h4><p>On most flights, as soon as the plane arrives at the gate and the seatbelt sign is turned off, people rush to stand up and gather their luggage. But it's always going to take several minutes to even start getting the first passengers off the plane, and it's not going to go any faster to crowd into the aisle.  </p><p>If we all follow these \"rules,\" flying can be a more pleasant experience for everyone—even our good doggo friends who might be on board. </p>",

The samples were taken from seven of the body’s systems: cardiovascular (heart and aorta), digestive (liver, pancreas, and intestine), immune (spleen and lymph node), endocrine (adrenal gland and white adipose), respiratory (lung), integumentary (skin), and musculoskeletal (muscle).</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"old watch, aging hands, senior women, wrinkled hands, time, passing of time,\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"002f8\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTQxNzI4Ni9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NDM5MzE0NX0.dRGlRxPG0hwwvGhH4Bi7JOcUu3dmI6Hz-0hYQs77P6E/img.png?width=980\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A senior woman's hands holding a watch. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">via <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Canva/Photos</a></small></p><h2>The body’s aging process speeds up between 45 and 55</h2><p>After studying the proteins found in different systems, the researchers found that the most stark changes in the aging process occurred between the ages of 45 and 55. The greatest amount of changes happened in the aorta, the body’s main artery that runs that passes over the heart from the left ventricle and runs down the front of the backbone.</p><p>The researchers hope that their work will eventually lead to mapping of the entire body, where we can better understand the process on an organ-by-organ basis. That could lead to one day having different biological ages for various body parts based on proteins and lifestyle choices. One could have a liver that's 35 and an aorta in its 50s. \"These insights may facilitate the development of targeted interventions for aging and age-related diseases, paving the way to improve the health of older adults,\" the authors concluded.</p><p>It may be a bit jarring for younger people to know that just like they may have enjoyed a growth spurt while in high school, they can also look forward to an aging spurt that happens at 50. The good news is that if you are past 55, then you are likely to be able to look forward to a phase where the aging process slows down a bit. </p>",

All at once, clues about humanity’s past, present, and future are revealed. </p><p>For instance, why do so many words with a negative connotation begin with the letter “n”? Sure, there are obvious exceptions, like nice, nifty, neat, etc., but when you think about not, never, nothing, nihilistic, nought, and yes, even the word negative itself…seems like a lot. Is this just an English language thing? Does the letter “n” have an inherently negative quality in our collective psyche? If so…why? </p><p>This was a topic recently tackled by etymology enthusiast <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dn0qwJlkqcg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>@humanteneleven</u></a>. In a short-and-sweet video, he explains that in the days of Old English, the word “ne,” meaning “not,” was used to negate, or give the opposite meaning, of virtually anything. N + one + “none,” n + either + \"neither,\" and so on. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">- YouTube</small>        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">                <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dn0qwJlkqcg\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com</a>        </small>        </p><p>Even with English words that were borrowed from Latin, as well as other non-English languages like French, German, Russian, and Sanskrit, we see this pattern. That’s because the Proto-Indo-European language, the mother of all these languages, also used the word “ne” to negate meaning. </p><p>However, just to complicate things a bit, we also see this in languages that did not originate from Proto-Indo-European, like Japanese and Vietnamese. This prompted a linguist by the name of Otto Jespersen in the late 1880s to theorize that there must be some primal association of negative feelings with the “n” sound. According to him, it was carried over from when ancient humans scrunch up their nose in contempt, and the sound would follow. “The biological reaction of disgust is inherently nasal,” explained @humanteneleven.</p><p>Over a hundred years later, <a href=\"https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/lingty-2020-2034/html?lang=en&amp;srsltid=AfmBOorhtW86XpKc2JTSrAsDRb4uXQbBIya_E-f5Z9XbtJ2Se73UL0RE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>researchers</u></a> tested the theory, and found that this correlation was more of a coincidence.

      "summary": "<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Few North American mammals are so phantasmal as the Canada lynx, a grey ghost of a hunter primarily found in the continent’s sprawling boreal forest. Getting a good look at these normally ultra-elusive wildcats makes for a red-letter day. One such day just transpired in Minnesota, USA, along the extreme southern fringes of that taiga realm.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarah Hamilton, the owner of the Trail Center Lodge in Grand Marais, <span><a href=\"https://www.aol.com/watch-lodge-owner-captures-close-155918362.html\" target=\"_blank\">filmed a lynx</a></span> pacing along the property’s snowy deck on February 23rd. It’s a strikingly up-close and extended view of a carnivore rarely spied at all in the state. A dog inside certainly seems plenty excited by the sighting, its barks at one point in the footage causing the lynx to cast a bit of side-eye. (Back in 2020, an even rarer observation—a <span><a href=\"https://www.earthtouchnews.com/discoveries/discoveries/black-lynx-spotted-in-canada-and-theres-footage-to-prove-it/\">black, aka melanistic, lynx in Yukon, Canada</a></span>—inspired a similar uproar from a pooch.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Trail Center Lodge lies along the Gunflint Trail, a historic highway set in the Border Lakes ecoregion of far northeastern Minnesota near the state’s border with Ontario (and the expansive <span><a href=\"https://wilderness.net/visit-wilderness/?ID=70\">Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness</a></span>). This corner of the state has produced the <span><a href=\"https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/nhnrp/lynx_sightings.html\">majority of recent lynx sightings in Minnesota</a></span>.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The great bulk of that boreal forest lapping down into Minnesota and some other northerly parts of the lower 48 U.S. states lies in Canada and Alaska, and that’s also where most of Canada’s lynx reside. Studies suggest Minnesota harbours a <span><a href=\"https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/rsg/profile.html?action=elementDetail&amp;selectedElement=AMAJH03010\">small, low-density breeding population of lynx</a></span> as well as Canadian wanderers coming down from the north, their patterns more tied to the boom-and-bust population cycles of the snowshoe hare, the wildcat’s preferred prey. (The outsized paws of the Canada lynx allow it to float over the snowpack: a valuable adaptation when <span><a href=\"https://www.earthtouchnews.com/natural-world/predator-vs-prey/lynx-family-of-six-chases-a-hare-in-rare-sighting-video/\">pursuing the similarly endowed hare</a></span> through the boreal woods, where Old Man Winter holds court for a big chunk of the year.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Protected in Minnesota since 1984, the Canada lynx in the “Lower 48” is a federally threatened species. Another member of the lynx genus, the bobcat, is vastly more numerous in Minnesota, vastly more widespread in the conterminous US, and a textbook generalist sort of carnivore compared to its heavily (<span><a href=\"https://www.earthtouchnews.com/natural-world/predator-vs-prey/lynx-chases-squirrel-up-a-tree-plan-quickly-backfires/\">though not exclusively</a></span>) hare-focused cousin. It also seems more tolerant of human activity and development (case in point: <span><a href=\"https://www.earthtouchnews.com/in-the-field/backyard-wildlife/city-bobcat-nabs-squirrel-scampers-down-a-storm-drain/\">hauling urban squirrels down into storm drains</a></span>).</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stubbier, comparatively small-footed bobcat looks smaller than the lanky and lithe Canada lynx, but in fact these two medium-sized wildcats overlap significantly in the weight department. Generally speaking, the bobcat, which can thrive everywhere from hardwood forests and swamps to prairies and deserts, seems to essentially “take over” for the Canada lynx south of the taiga (though in western North America the latter does haunt a modest range southward into the high-elevation conifer forests of the U.S. Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest, also bobcat country). Some evidence suggests that potential climate-change impacts on snow cover and depth regimes<span><a href=\"https://www.facetsjournal.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/facets-2019-0019\"> might allow bobcats to invade northward</a></span> at the expense of the grey ghost.</p>\n<hr class=\"related-link\" />\n    <div class=\"related-more\">\n        <span>\n            Read more:\n            <a href=\"https://www.earthtouchnews.com/natural-world/animal-behaviour/nimble-arizona-bobcat-scales-a-tall-saguaro-cactus\">\n\t\t\tNimble Arizona bobcat scales a tall saguaro cactus\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</a>\n        </span>\n    </div>\n    <hr class=\"related-link\" />\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s worth acknowledging that Minnesota has a third—and much heftier—native felid: the cougar or puma, extirpated from the state during the early phase of Euro-American settlement, but <span><a href=\"https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/mammals/cougar/index.html\">increasingly showing up</a></span> in these old haunts of theirs.

And the city of Clyde in north Texas missed two debt payments last year during a prolonged dry spell.  \n<br><br>\nEach episode underscores how climate shocks once seen as exceptional are now straining local budgets, but drought may be the most insidious of these threats.

In reality, many people invest in continuing education and are then stuck paying off student loans for a large chunk of their lives.\n</p><p>\n\tThat’s what happened to Jasmin Ford, a nurse in Chicago. She was dealing with a large debt and struggling to pay it off by working two jobs. Then, something incredible happened to her – the debt vanished. Here's how it all went down.\n</p><h3>A Familiar Story: Graduating With Debt</h3><br /><img alt=\"jasmin ford and her son\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"12dcd\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/jasmin-ford-and-her-son.png?id=54969765&amp;width=980\" /><p><br /></p><h3></h3><br /><p>When Ford received her bachelor’s degree in 2011, she was the first person in her <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/family-quotes/\" target=\"_self\">family</a> to graduate from college. She was proud and didn’t stop there, returning to school to get her nursing degree.</p><p>It was tough, especially since Ford didn’t have any family assistance to help her to pay for things. In order to afford necessities like food and rent, plus her tuition, she relied on student loans, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Living/bank-surprises-single-mom-paying-off-150k-student/story?id=59797289\" target=\"_blank\">reports </a><em><a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Living/bank-surprises-single-mom-paying-off-150k-student/story?id=59797289\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ABC News</a>.</em></p><p>“I could not foresee when I’d be able to pay it off,” Ford told the publication. “I just knew this was going to be a part of my life as long as I was alive unless there was some significant change.”</p><h3>Arrival of Surprising News</h3><br /><p>At 30 years old, Ford was working nearly every day at two jobs and providing for her two-year-old son, Caleb. She didn’t see an end in sight, but then out of nowhere, Fifth Third Bank contacted her and told her it was paying off her $150,000 loans, free and clear.</p><blockquote><strong></strong>“I still can’t find the words [...] I’m off work again today, and I’m just sort of pacing around and restless because I know my life is going to change.” -Jasmin Ford</blockquote><p>The bank had selected Ford after she was chosen to participate in a documentary about student loan debt. She thought the crew was coming to her house to shoot some extra footage when they dropped the news.</p><p>“The documentary in itself was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” she continued. “I’m a South Side of Chicago nurse and I have a kid, that in itself is not that exciting, and I got to be in a documentary and I met some amazing people on the way.”</p><h3>A Life-Changing Moment</h3><br /><p>Ford was surprised by the amazing gesture, and knows it is a game changer for herself and her son.</p><p>“His life will be totally different,” she said. “I’m so happy and so proud that I’m able to offer that to him more than anything else because he deserves it.”</p><p>Looking forward, Ford is excited to pay it forward with her nursing degree, but also just to have more freedom, both <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/mental-health-quotes/\" target=\"_self\">mentally</a> and physically. She wants to spend less time hustling and more time with her family, all while embracing what comes next.</p><p>“I can open myself to more experiences, opportunities and just be able to sit and be with my thoughts and be able to pursue what it is I came to do,” she added.</p><h3>A Lesson in Perseverance</h3><br /><p>Ford’s story is a perfect example of the fact that while there’s something to be said for pursuing your <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/goals-quotes/\" target=\"_self\">dreams</a> and working hard, the road to success isn’t always easy. In fact, sometimes it feels completely riddled with obstacles that may make you want to give up.</p><p>But sometimes, good things really do happen to good people. Ford wasn’t expecting this level of help, but she knows just how game-changing it is.</p><p>Her story inspires many to hold onto hope and keep stepping forward even when the path is uphill because, in the end, it will somehow work out.</p><p>We just need to hold onto faith and, when times get tough, remember to keep pushing through.</p><h3></h3><br /><p><strong>More from Goalcast:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/man-buys-bank-that-refused-loan-18-years-ago/\" target=\"_self\">Man Buys The Bank That Refused Him A Loan When He Was Broke 18 Years Ago</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/nurse-lottery-mansion-omaze/\" target=\"_self\">Homeless Student Nurse Couch Surfs to Survive–but Christmas Came Early When She Wins $6M Home in Lottery</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/debt-community-facebook-mom-jeans/\" target=\"_self\">Struggling Single Mom With Staggering Debt Decides to Make a Change — And Bring Others With Her</a></li></ul><p></p><div class=\"rm-shortcode\">\n<div class=\"jwplayer-media\" id=\"botr_vhW9ib0F_rfvUMj7m_div\">\n<img class=\"jwplayer-media-preview\" src=\"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/vhW9ib0F-1920.jpg\" />\n</div>\n\n</div><br /><p></p><p>\n<br />\n</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><br />\n</h2>",

That’s particularly true for some teens, who work these jobs for part-time <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/how-to-save-money/\" target=\"_blank\">money</a> and are often <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/adult-bullying-is-real-heres-how-to-handle-it/\" target=\"_blank\">bullied</a> by adults. Perhaps that’s why people are applauding these teen girls for the way they expertly handled an over-the-top customer.</p><hr /><h3>An Angry Customer</h3><br /><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\">\n<div style=\"padding: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;\">\n<div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\">\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C883KFHuHkU/\" style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_top\">See on Instagram</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote><p>It was a tough day for employees at Keke’s Snow Balls in Texas when an angry woman approached the window. She had placed a pickup order for a snow cone and because of a shift change, the snow cone wasn’t ready. Two days later, the customer came back and demanded a refund of $6.</p><p>A girl named Victoria was working the counter and listened to the woman’s complaints. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CPIa1OpxEM\" target=\"_blank\">According to <em>Inside Edition</em></a>, it was immediately clear this woman didn’t want to resolve things in the right way, and was trying to pick a fight. Another employee named Kaeley overheard it all.</p><p>“I was just listening in the back and, eventually, I could just hear she’s angry the whole time. So I was like, clearly she just wants to have a problem,” Kaeley recalled to the publication. “And I’m not about that, so I was like, ‘Okay let me just go give her $6 and we can move on, move past this.’ It was $6.”</p><h3>An Unexpected Turn</h3><br /><p>At that point, the situation should have been resolved. However, Kaeley noticed the sign outside the window had fallen over during the dispute. So, she opened the window to fix it. That’s when the woman came by, slapped the sign out of the 17-year-old girl’s hand, and called her a derogatory name.</p><p>“M’am, please don’t act like that. You’re a grown woman,” Kaeley responded in a video that the restaurant then <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@kekessnowballs/video/7385726944513428767\" target=\"_blank\">posted to TikTok</a>. “You’re a grown woman. I’m 17. Get out of here. Don’t come back. Don’t come back. We don’t need your business.”</p><p>“I was scared and very confused,” Victoria added. “I wasn’t understanding what was going on.”</p><h3>A Brilliant Online Reaction</h3><br /><p>After the owner posted the video online, it went viral and many people reached out to support the girls for their perfect reaction to the customer.</p><p>“People were traveling to come and see us from hours away,” the owner, Kyle, told <em>Inside Edition</em>. “We had people reaching out to us on TikTok asking how to tip the girls. We even had people going and leaving Google reviews that haven’t even been to the shop, saying they’re so proud of the girls and how they dealt with it,” he continued. </p><p>Kyle explained that he posted the video to remind everyone that the employees behind the counter are people, too. Adults, in particular, should try to remember that oftentimes, these are kids working to save up for cars, school, and other big life steps.</p><p>“Mistakes happen, but for you to go up and act like that as an adult, my whole point in uploading that video is to simply remind us all that we need to treat people better,” Kyle added.</p><p>\"I am proud of the way our supervisor handled the situation,\" he added in <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C883KFHuHkU/\" target=\"_blank\">the initial post</a>. \"We must strive for better behavior and respect in all interactions. It’s all about just being a kind person and approaching every situation with willingness to come to a good resolution.\"</p><h3>We Are All the Same</h3><br /><p>As Kyle himself said, mistakes happen and no one is perfect. But demanding <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/why-youre-perfect-just-as-you-are/\" target=\"_blank\">perfection</a> of others can be a very lonely way to live. Rather than getting upset over an honest mistake and making someone feel bad or yelling at them, lead with grace and understanding. Not only will you help someone else feel respected, but you’ll probably get a better result from the situation, too.</p><p>When life doesn’t go our way, it can be easy to overreact or blame someone else. But by remembering that mistakes happen and this too shall pass, we can all live a little more peacefully.</p><p>Many of us are in these jobs because we’re trying to provide for our families or ourselves and our futures. Going to work can be hard enough, so remember to thank those who help you in the customer service industry and to tip well when appropriate. After all, we all want to feel appreciated at work. </p>",

And in today’s world, our stress levels are higher than ever. But many people are actually making their lives much harder than they need to be, all without realizing it. My name’s Freeman and I’m an international life coach who’s gone from surviving to thriving through simple but effective changes. Now I help others to do the same. So how do you know if you’re making your life harder than it needs to be? Here’s a few simple signs that can help you understand yourself, as well as driving more self-awareness and positive change.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>Sign 1. You’re life is driven by externals</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Our modern world is monetised by capturing our attention. The “ping, ding, and ring”… We’re surrounded by notifications and information sent straight to the phone in our pockets. This global addiction is something we know damages our mental wellbeing and so it’s critical to take a conscious awareness to technology. I’m not saying to chuck your phone in a lake, but bringing mindful balance to our usage (because we all love a good scroll sometimes) and making sure that you’re also creating space for in-person connections.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>Sign 2: You’re neglecting your self-care</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In our fast-paced societies, hard work is perceived to be rewarded. Which leads many people to overworking themselves and often burning out. I used to follow an all-hours lifestyle, working all day and DJing all night, until one day my body began to break down. But you don’t have to wait for the wake-up call. Integrating self-care can break the busyness pattern, whether that’s taking regular 5 minute meditations, treating yourself with a hot bath, or prioritising sleep. Investing in yourself first will make your life easier and more enjoyable in the long run.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>Sign 3: You’re straying from authenticity</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>We’re constantly being told that we need to live in certain ways. Whether that’s working harder, earning more money, or getting married. Following other people’s definition of success often sacrifices the dreams you actually want to achieve in life. And often people ignore their true calling deep-down to live a life that’s more “realistic”. As Einstein said, ‘The person who follows the crowd will usually go no further than the crowd. The person who walks alone is likely to find himself in places no one has ever seen before.’ Living an inauthentic life only leaves you feeling unfulfilled and becomes a secret stress creator. I too used to be stuck in this trap, until I stepped out of my comfort zone, to experience solo travels and started my journey to living a life of possibility and purpose. You deserve to live authentically, too. Start by asking yourself, what is it that truly brings me joy?</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>Sign 4: You’re trying to avoid failures</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Failure is something that our cultures have regularly demonised. But the truth is, with every success, there are plenty of failures. Even Thomas Edision failed a thousand times before he invented the light bulb. When we get to see that failure is just a healthy part of life, we get to play bigger. We become grateful for the valuable lessons that come to our journey.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>Sign 5: You don’t believe you’re capable of great things</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This can be a tough pill to swallow. Life isn’t difficult because life itself is really difficult, but because we choose to believe life is difficult, consciously or subconsciously. What that means is you are the creator of your reality; either believing life is happening “to you” or life is happening “for you”, it’s your choice. Start making powerful shifts by reflecting on your strengths. Build your self esteem through celebrating your wins. Believe that there is limitless potential to be realised within you.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>If you find yourself living in survival mode, it’s time to pause.

The Trollhättan waterfalls have been used for hydropower and boat travel since the 19th century and the town is well known for its King Oscar's Bridge which overlooks the powerful Trollhättan Falls.</p>\n<p>Somewhere along the way, Swedish royalty began to memorialize their visits to the town by putting their signature on this large rock which sits just below the bridge. Many visiting monarchs and personages have carved their name into the rock, with the oldest entry dating back to 1754, when King Adolf Fredrik and Queen Louisa Ulrika first started the tradition.</p>\n<p>The exact reason why this particular rock was used is unknown, but it became known as the Kungsgrottan soon after, even though it is not even a proper cave or grotto. Today there are over a dozen royal signatures, including that of the current heir to the Swedish throne, Crown Princess Victoria, who left her mark on the Kungsgrottan in 2001. Perhaps the royals chose to carve their names there simply because the spot offers a beautiful view over the waterfalls.</p>\n<p>You can find the King's Cave right before Oscar Bridge, down a small flight of stairs.</p>",

And with the holidays on the horizon, one doctor is gently reminding folks the importance of partying responsibly—during the holidays and all year round.</p><p><a href=\"https://pages.doctorhoeflinger.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Brian Hoeflinger</a>, an Ohio based neurosurgeon with over two decades of experience, has a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@doctorhoeflinger\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TikTok channel</a> filled with educational videos and lifestyle tips. In late 2022, smack-dab in the middle of the holiday season, Dr. Hoeflinger shared a clip explaining just how long it takes our bodies to break down alcohol, and it went viral. In the video, which was shared on Christmas Eve of that year, Dr. Hoeflinger sets the scene of a party where “a lot of drinks are going down” by setting up a bunch of shot glasses filled with water.</p><p>“Say you’re having five drinks in the first hour,” he says, taking five water-filled shots. “As you’re taking them, that alcohol is building up in your system fast. [It] goes to your brain within five minutes and starts to affect you.\"</p><p>The same can’t be said for other parts of the body. As Dr. Hoeflinger noted, “Your liver only metabolizes one ounce of alcohol per hour.” And according to <a href=\"https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/alcohol-and-the-brain#:~:text=It%20is%20absorbed%20through%20the,your%20liver%20starts%20processing%20alcohol.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Northwestern Medicine</a>, that process only begins 20 minutes after consumption.</p><p>Hoeflinger continues, “I've got five ounces of liquor in my system right now, and at the end of the hour I'm only going to burn off an ounce…so I'm going to have [four] ounces left in my bloodstream.”</p><blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@doctorhoeflinger/video/7180782044249623854\" class=\"tiktok-embed\">\n        <section>\n            <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@doctorhoeflinger\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@doctorhoeflinger\">@doctorhoeflinger</a>\n            <p>Knowing this about drinking could save your life! #fyp #party #drinking #alcohol #foryou #holiday #christmas</p>\n        </section>\n    </blockquote>\n                            <p>Of course, there are different factors—such as body mass, hormones, medications, etc.—that affect someone’s <a href=\"https://consensus.app/questions/alcohol-absorption-rate/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">rate of absorption</a>. And yes, we might be able to form a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/alcohol-tolerance\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">functional tolerance</a> where behaviorally, we show no signs of intoxication. However, even with all these variables, for the most part all bodies are <a href=\"https://caps.ucsc.edu/counseling/aod/alcohol-facts-tips.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">affected by alcohol similarly</a>. In other words, your blood alcohol level will be more or less the same, and the risks will remain even if you don't \"feel drunk.\"</p><p>Hoeflinger continues, saying, “The party’s rockin’, so we’re gonna have some more,” while taking three more shots and reminding viewers that he still has only burned off one ounce of liquor during the hour that’s passed.</p><p>Now he’s had a total of eight ounces of alcohol in two hours. He’s burned off two, but still has six ounces left in his system—meaning that in this scenario, it will take another six hours to completely burn off.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"shots, alcohol, holiday, party, halloween, christmas, new years eve\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f4802\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjAwMTg2Ny9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NjIxNDk2M30.Sh7J8KZuQ624IMl4b2f0hK9bXG2IhxIkWUcWG0JSI68/img.png?width=933&amp;height=630&amp;quality=50&amp;coordinates=135%2C0%2C132%2C0\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Shots</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos/\" target=\"_blank\">via Canva Photos.</a></small></p><p>In hour three, Hoefligner takes one shot since the party is “winding down.” This brings him up to a total of nine ounces of alcohol over three hours. His liver has metabolized three ounces, leaving him (still) with six ounces of liquor left in his bloodstream.</p><p>“You’re going to be drunk well into the wee hours of the morning; it doesn’t wear off,” he warns, noting the common misconception people have that “they stop drinking an hour or two and can hop in the car and drive.\" But in reality, \"You can't do that as you're still drunk five, six hours down,” he explains.</p><p>Dr. Hoeflinger concludes his video by saying:</p><p>\"For this holiday season the whole point is I really want to tell people that's how alcohol can stack up in your system easily when you're drunk and you won't know it and it won't wear off for hours and hours down the road.\" This is followed by an urge for people to take an Uber or Lyft home to avoid potentially taking their own or another’s life.</p><p>The informative clip, which has since been viewed over 19 million times, received a flood of praise from viewers online, especially from parents with kids of a drinking age.</p><p>“This is the first time I have ever had anyone explain this in this way. I am forwarding this to my son,” wrote one parent.</p><p>It also resonated among designated drivers. One person commented, “thank you for caring and educating. I’m the sober ride. I've seen the devastation from drinking and driving.”</p><p>The topic hits Dr. Hoeflinger on a personal level as well. In a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@doctorhoeflinger/video/7180439326407265582?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">previous video</a>, he shared that he lost his 18-year old son nearly a decade ago from drunk driving. Coming from a medical professional, the plea to not drink and drive is important to hear. But as a parent, it hits different. As he shared in the clip, “Losing somebody you love is one of the worst experiences you can have in your life.”</p><blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@doctorhoeflinger/video/7180439326407265582\" class=\"tiktok-embed\">\n        <section>\n            <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@doctorhoeflinger\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@doctorhoeflinger\">@doctorhoeflinger</a>\n            <p>Have a plan this holiday season.

Yes, you know about the paid time off sitting in your account. You <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/boss-staff-complaints-ex1\" target=\"_blank\">worked for it</a>. But as the year slips by, each month, it remains unused. Suddenly, it’s nearly the end of <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/dad-credits-taylor-swift-s-cruel-summer-for-activating-his-daughter-to-win-mma-match\" target=\"_blank\">summer</a>, with no <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/what-you-don-t-see-in-our-idyllic-family-vacation-photos\" target=\"_blank\">vacations</a>, no <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/man-depicts-what-its-like-to-road-trip-with-an-xennial\" target=\"_blank\">road trips</a>, or even overnight plans to see your favorite cousin on the horizon.</p><p>Why? You’ve earned those days fair and square. They’re yours. But with that earned time also comes a nagging guilt, which can take the form of voices saying “I’m too busy,” or “the rest of the team will resent me” when <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/workplace-stress-quiet-cracking\" target=\"_blank\">you need to rest the most</a>.</p><p><br /></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">- YouTube</small>        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">                <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NewyYISc6Cs&amp;pp=ygULc2lnZ2lzIHB0eW8%3D\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com</a>        </small>        </p><p>Which brings us to an unexpected champion: <a href=\"https://siggis.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">siggi’s</a>, the Icelandic yogurt company that’s calling out America’s toxic work culture. In a campaign that’s as refreshing as their skyr (a thick, creamy, high-protein yogurt that hails from founder Siggi Hilmarsson’s home country, Iceland), siggi’s is offering $5,000 plus a $1,000 flight voucher to ten Americans who commit to taking all their paid time off this year. It’s called the “PT-YO Challenge,” and it’s rooted in something that might surprise you—Iceland’s approach to work-life balance and their consistently high rankings in global happiness indexes.</p><h2><strong>Iceland PTO policies: A model for well-being</strong></h2><p>While Americans struggle to use their limited vacation days, Iceland has built an entire culture around the importance of rest. Icelandic workers are <a href=\"https://blog.europa.jobs/en/art-public-holidays-and-days-off-in-iceland-2025/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">legally entitled to 24 days of paid vacation per year</a>, regardless of whether they’re part-time or full-time employees. On top of this, Iceland observes <a href=\"https://www.playroll.com/global-hiring-guides/iceland\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">13 public holidays each year</a> (including Christmas Eve, Christmas, <em>and</em> the day after Christmas, which they refer to as “Second Day of Christmas”), bringing Iceland’s total guaranteed time off to at least 37 days.</p><p>Sounds nice, right? That’s because it is.</p><p><br /></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"siggi's, vacation, challenge, skyr, time off\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"59cfe\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTQxNzU3My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5NjU2MzIzN30.iaG1UQl8QBal2w6vD_L8657M92AcENQdPWdRB45jUJY/img.jpg?width=980\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">siggi's is challenging Americans to use their PTO.

Countries with robust vacation cultures, like Denmark (which grants workers 25 days of PTO), the United Kingdom (28 days), and France (25 days) report higher job satisfaction, better mental health, and improved organizational loyalty.</p><p>So, in Iceland, taking your vacation isn’t seen as slacking off—it’s seen as essential maintenance for both your mental health and your ability to contribute meaningfully when you return.</p><p>It’s a virtuous cycle that benefits everyone: rested people are more effective at work. Simple as that.</p><p>“As an entrepreneur, I know how hard it is to step away,” said Siggi Hilmarsson, the company’s founder, in a press release. “But stepping away is where the real breakthroughs happen.”</p><p>And it’s more than talk. Beyond the PT-YO challenge, siggi’s and its parent company <a href=\"https://lactalisyogurtusa.com/careers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lactalis Group</a> support and offer a competitive suite of benefits for employees. Upon hire, siggi’s workers are granted automatic PTO days, and can build towards life insurance and a generous 401K plan.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://siggis.com/live-simply\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">mantra</a> here? “Life is stressful—but you’ll be surprised by how much simpler it gets when you slow down.”</p><p><br /></p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/iceland-RMTYzWW6FPWFoyuUmR\">via GIPHY</a></p></div><p><br /></p><h2><strong>America’s PTO problem: Why aren’t we taking time off?</strong></h2><p>Now, for the not-so-fun part. The contrast with American work culture is stark. Unlike Iceland and most European nations, the United States <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/workhours/vacation_leave\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">lacks any federal law</a> mandating paid vacation, personal time, or paid time off for private-sector workers. The average American private-sector worker receives about <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-state-of-paid-time-off-in-the-u-s-in-2024\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">12 days of PTO per year</a>, less than half of what Icelandic workers get as a legal minimum. But remember, this only goes for those with full benefits, and many workers (especially low-wage, part-time, or gig employees) get <a href=\"https://www.footholdamerica.com/blog/paid-time-off-in-the-usa-a-crucial-benefit-or-costly-perk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">far less or even none</a>.</p><p>But here’s the kicker: even those measly 12 days often go unused. A <a href=\"https://www.lanereport.com/175306/2024/07/one-third-of-u-s-employees-pto-vacation-days-go-unused\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2024 study found</a> that nearly two-thirds (62%) of Americans do not use all of their PTO, with 5.5% of American workers not using <em>any</em> of their PTO at all. The <a href=\"https://www.getsorbet.net/sorbet_pto_report_2024.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">same study</a> revealed that on average, employees only use 67% of their PTO allocation, leaving 33% behind! How many days is that, collectively? Well, siggi’s <a href=\"https://siggis.com/ptyo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">did the math</a>.</p><p>Americans left 700 million PTO days unused in 2024. That translates to $312 billion in untouched vacation days, just sitting there, relaxing, like you were supposed to be in Saint-Tropez last year. That’s not a typo, by the way. Billion.

Yet for millions of people, purpose feels elusive, like some far-off destination, an epiphany waiting for divine intervention.</p><p>Narratives around living the life of your dreams can package purpose in a very set way, telling stories of a select few who were lucky enough to find their purpose, and never looked back.</p><p>All of these assumptions about purpose make it both intimidating and seemingly unattainable. Factor in cultural ideas of what purpose looks like — from starting a billion-dollar venture in Silicon Valley to living a life in service of the greater good — and you’ll likely be left feeling frustrated, or confused, about how to add purpose to your life.</p><p>Fortunately, these assumptions are misleading. Purpose is much easier to attain than it seems on the surface. And, thankfully, the Japanese concept of ikigai makes discovering your purpose practical. There’s no need to wait for a eureka moment, or yearn for the day purpose will arrive on your doorstep. With ikigai as your own personal Japanese secret, you can start taking deliberate steps to add purpose to your days and inhabit a more happy life. This article will show you how you can start your own personal ikigai journey. Let’s get started!</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-japanese-concept-of-ikigai\">What is the Japanese concept of Ikigai?</h2><p>The best translation for ikigai (pronounced “ee key guy”) is “a reason for being.” The term is formed from the Japanese words iki (life) and gai (worth or benefit).</p><p>Ikigai is central to Japanese culture, with its origin stretching all the way back to the Heian period, a period of classical Japanese history lasting between the years 794 and 1185.</p><p>American researcher Dan Buettner, who presented the popular Ted Talk How to Live to 100, identified ikigai as one of the main factors for greater longevity in Japan. Buettner popularized the concept in the West in the early 2000s.</p><p>Long before then, Japanese psychiatrist Mieko Kamiya, the Mother of Ikigai, wrote one of the most popular modern-day books on the philosophy, Ikigai-ni-Tsuite (What Makes Our Life Worth Living), in 1966. This was around the time early positive psychology was born. Psychologists such as Abraham Maslow, Carl Rogers, and Viktor Frankl shifted the paradigm of psychology away from pathology, and towards what makes for a fulfilling, meaningful life.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Maslow\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"11c35\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/maslow.jpg?id=51945982&amp;width=980\" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"moving-towards-a-more-meaningful-life\">Moving towards a more meaningful life</h3><p>Kamiya herself compared ikigai to Frankl’s approach to meaning. Both were well-versed in how suffering could lead to personal growth. Frankl from his time spent in concentration camps during the Holocaust, and Kamiya worked with leprosy patients. Kamiya described ikigai as:</p><p>“Ikigai means ‘power necessary for one to live in this world, happiness to be alive, benefit, effectiveness.’ When we try to translate it into English, German, French etc, it seems that there is no other way to define it other than ‘worth living’ or ‘value or meaning to live’. Thus, compared to philosophical theoretical concepts, the word ikigai shows us how ambiguous the Japanese language is, but because of this it has an effect of reverberation and amplitude.”</p><p>She acknowledged that “the fact that this word exists should indicate that the goal to live, its meaning and value within the daily life of the Japanese soul has been problematized.” In other words, the word exists because modern-living, to some degree, has disconnected people from their innate sense of purpose, or their soul’s calling.</p><p>Kamiya further defines ikigai into two categories — the source of ikigai, and the state of mind someone feels when connected to the source (ikigai-kan). For Kamiya, ikigai-kan is linked to Frankl’s concept of meaning. In life, a person’s mission is to connect to their mission. Failure to do so can result in depression or anxiety.</p><p>In order to become clear on this mission, Kamiya suggested two questions:</p><ol><li>What is my existence for?</li><li>What is the purpose of my existence?</li></ol><h3 id=\"gaining-clarity\">Gaining Clarity</h3><p>Once clarity is gained, ikigai becomes the North Star that you are guided to. The journey itself is what’s important, not the final destination. Those who are moving towards that North Star experience a sense of fulfillment, ikigai-kan.</p><p>Kamiya was careful to note those pursuing their purpose weren’t always distinguished people — someone can be in service to ikigai when raising children, teaching at schools, or working in medicine. What’s most important is that a person is able to connect to their purpose, and honor it, in whichever way is unique to them.</p><p>For Kamiya, the process of clarifying and honoring their soul’s calling is the discovery of a new theme of existence. For many people, this process could unfold during a spiritual awakening, where their motivations radically transform. For others, it could be a slight, but noticeable change of direction.</p><h2 id=\"ikigai-and-maslow-s-hierarchy-of-needs\">Ikigai and Maslow’s hierarchy of needs</h2><p>In addition to parallels between Frankl’s work on the value of meaning, Kamiya also discovered that to experience ikigai-kan, someone must first have several personal needs met. The result is a similar model of thinking to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, which outlines the journey of growth and self-actualization.</p><p>The needs Kamiya identified are:</p><p>The need for life satisfaction<br />The need for change and growth<br />The need for a bright future<br />The need for resonance<br />The need for freedom<br />The need for self-actualization<br />The need for meaning and value</p><p>These closely resemble Maslow’s pyramid of physiological needs, safety needs, love and belonging, esteem, self-actualization, and self-transcendence (the often forgotten additional layer). It’s worth keeping in mind, though, that Maslow noted for some, lower levels can be transcended by higher values, such as creativity being more important than safety needs or esteem.</p><p>The same can be said of ikigai — if your mission or purpose is something greater than you, it’s likely that it can overshadow other personal needs and contribute to well being.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-ikigai-important-for-a-fulfilling-life\">Why is Ikigai important for a fulfilling life?</h2><p>As Buettner discovered, meaning is one of the most influential factors in living a long and healthy life, both for younger generations and those that are older. Buettner has researched so-called Blue Zones, the locations where people lived for longer and enjoyed greater wellbeing.</p><p>Five locations Buettner discovered were Okinawa, Japan; Sardinia, Italy; Nicoya, Costa Rica; Ikaria, Greece, and Loma Linda, California. He noticed that these five locations placed a lot of emphasis on meaning and purpose.</p><p>This has been backed up by multiple studies. A 2014 UCL-led study of 9,000 people with an average age of 65 found that those with a greater sense of meaning and purpose were 30 percent less likely to die in the following eight-year period. More recently in 2019, a study of 7,000 people over the age of 50 found “life purpose was significantly associated with all-cause mortality.” So much so, the lowest scorers of the study were twice as likely to have died than those with the highest scores five years later.</p><h3 id=\"the-power-of-ikigai\">The power of ikigai</h3><p>Noriyuki Nakashi, from Osaka University, explains the power of ikigai as:</p><p>“Ikigai is personal: it reflects the inner self of an individual and expresses that faithfully.<br />Ikigai, which is the highest level of desire, may be considered to be essentially the process of cultivating one’s inner potential and that which makes one's life significant, a universal human experience we all wish to achieve.”</p><p>Purpose gives you a deeper reason for living, it makes your life significant. As noted by thinkers such as Kamiya and Frankl, there is an interesting component to this — it appears, deep down, each of us has a purpose that we intuitively know and understand. Our mission is to listen to that calling and do all we can to honor it, in order to cultivate our inner potential.</p><p>Longevity is a byproduct of doing something right. Purpose gives you the energy and inspiration to pursue your goals, overcome struggle, and keep going when times are tough. It provides strong foundations of fulfillment and can give your life a new direction, not towards fleeting happiness, but towards things of high value. In the words of Oscar Wilde: “To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.”</p><h2 id=\"understanding-the-ikigai-chart-and-your-own-ikigai-journey\">Understanding the Ikigai chart and your own ikigai journey</h2><p>Are you ready for your mind to be blown by ikigai, the Japanese secret that so many swear by? For your understanding of ikigai to take a drastic u-turn into a new theme of existence? The ikigai venn diagram, shared by millions and rising to meme-like popularity on social media, isn’t linked to ikigai. Instead, it was an idea from Marc Winn, an entrepreneur and blogger who merged the idea of ikigai with a venn diagram of purpose.</p><p>Winn was introduced to the concept of ikigai and the ikigai diagram from Buettner’s Ted Talk. “I don’t know whether to laugh or cry,” he wrote in 2017, “less than an hour of my time has made more of a difference in the world than all my time put together.”</p><p>Winn acknowledges his own surprise that his idea, and the diagram, spiraled out of control. The diagram is shown below:</p><img alt=\"Ikigai: The True Meaning with Diagrams, Definitions, &amp; Myths | Sloww\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"52525\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/ikigai-the-true-meaning-with-diagrams-definitions-myths-sloww.jpg?id=51945986&amp;width=980\" /><p>While the venn diagram is incredibly useful, there’s one major downside — the true meaning of ikigai isn’t about making money. The diagram might be valuable in understanding how you can launch a career of meaning, but in many ways, it’s the result of ikigai running through the money-oriented worldview of the West.<br />In fact, a 2010 study of 2,000 people in Japan found that only a third saw work as their ikigai. In addition, the Japanese translation of life means both your lifespan, and everyday life. This leads to another possible misinterpretation — ikigai can be discovered in the simple, day-to-day joys of living, not a grandiose plan or life mission worthy of Hollywood fame. It’s a spectrum of joy, from the seemingly mundane to the miraculous, and everything between.</p><h2 id=\"the-five-pillars-of-ikigai\">The five pillars of ikigai</h2><p>So if the ikigai isn’t discovered through a venn diagram, how do you apply the concept to your life? In The Little Book of Ikigai, Japanese neuroscientist and author Ken Mogi offers a five-pillar framework. By following this framework, you’re able to cultivate the type of lifestyle that allows for the emergence of ikigai:</p><h3 id=\"pillar-one-start-small\">Pillar One: Start Small</h3><p>Discovering a new theme of existence begins with small steps. That could be as simple as making the inner commitment to start creating a life of enhanced purpose.</p><p>What changes could you make, today, to start that process? Is there a passion, or calling, that you sense on the periphery of your awareness? What could you do in order to start honoring that? Remember, purpose doesn’t have to be elaborate or grand.</p><p>Applying Kamiya’s work, you could journal and answer the two questions: what is my existence for? What is the purpose of my existence? Don’t think about it too much, just see what surfaces.</p><p>Additionally, consider what things in life are the source of ikigai, or when are the moments when you feel ikigai-kan. For me, writing is the source of both. Although now established as a writer, in the beginning, it started with a commitment to write a little every day.</p><h3 id=\"pillar-two-releasing-yourself\">Pillar Two: Releasing Yourself</h3><p>This pillar demonstrates how deep the philosophy of ikigai is, and its entanglement with other Eastern philosophies that have stood the test of time, such as Buddhism. </p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Buddhism\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"baf83\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/buddhism.jpg?id=51946000&amp;width=980\" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure><p>Releasing yourself means to let go of all the things in life you hold onto, that cause some form of suffering.</p><p>It’s similar to the Buddhist practices of non-attachment. Are you attached to your self-image, what other people think of you, or always thinking about a time you’ll finally be happy?</p><p>Releasing yourself requires accepting where you’re at, who you are, and the moment in front of you. It leads to a state of peaceful surrender, going with the flow, rather than grappling with life.</p><p>Ikigai is, after all, a practice of aligning with nature. “The greatest secret of the ikigai, ultimately, has to be the acceptance of oneself, no matter what kind of unique features one might happen to be born with,” Mogi writes.</p><h3 id=\"pillar-three-harmony-and-sustainability\">Pillar Three: Harmony and Sustainability</h3><p>This step is connected to your environment. Ikigai incorporates the people in our lives, our immediate community, the quality and sustainability of all living things we interact with.</p><p>As Mogi says, “A man is like a forest; individual and yet connected and dependent on others for growth.” Harmony and sustainability are both inner and outer experiences, reflected in your emotions, your thoughts, the way you interact with the world, the way you go about your work.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"a man is like a forest\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c07ba\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/a-man-is-like-a-forest.jpg?id=51945983&amp;width=980\" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure><p>Consider any area of life where there is disharmony. Perhaps you have a few relationships that cause friction, or you are pushing yourself to extremes, unable to sustain that approach to hustle culture for the long term. In what ways can you invite a more peaceful approach? How can you be the source of harmony, for yourself, and for the wider world around you?</p><p>That doesn’t have to mean being half-hearted in what you do, quite the opposite, as ikigai encourages commitment and passion in equal measure. But make sure not to fall into traps of seriousness, and keep an explorative, playful attitude to yourself, your relationships, your community, and your work.</p><h3 id=\"pillar-four-the-joy-of-little-things\">Pillar Four: The Joy of Little Things</h3><p>Ikigai is a comprehensive philosophy, as well as being an antidote to a lot of modern approaches to finding happiness through constant striving, or the craving for success or recognition.</p><p>Deeply embedded in the Japanese concept is finding joy in little things. Your morning coffee. A smile from a stranger. An unexpected spell of sunshine. A message from a friend you’ve not spoken to in a while. A delicious sip of energizing green tea. All of these are opportunities to enjoy small sparks of joy, sparks that pave the way for a life in honor of ikigai.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"green tea\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b96f5\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/green-tea.jpg?id=51945998&amp;width=980\" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure><p>As Kamiya notes, those dedicated to ikigai spend all their days in fulfillment. Yes, there might be a challenging process of realizing your calling, and adjusting your life to make sure you have supreme focus on fulfilling your potential. But ikigai isn’t about the end destination, it’s about smelling the flowers on the way.</p><p>The easiest way to do this is to look for gratitude in your life. What things bring you a sense of comfort? What in your life would you have never predicted or thought you’d be able to achieve? What have you overcome? Who adds laughter or who supports you? All of these reflections of gratitude support the feeling of ikigai-kan.</p><h3 id=\"h-pillar-five-being-in-the-here-and-now\">Pillar Five: Being in the Here and Now</h3><p>To reaffirm the intention of ikigai, and its link to mindfulness, the final pillar reminds us to be present. To pause. To become fully aware of what’s directly in front of us. To take things one step at a time, and notice when our minds get caught in the past, or jump ahead to the future. The more present you become, the richer life is, the more nourishing each moment, and the less fearful you become about uncertain futures.</p><p>The irony of trying to find happiness is that it keeps us always looking ahead, waiting for a moment to come. But as many Eastern philosophies have taught, that is an illusion. Only the present ever exists. And the more you’re able to truly arrive in the present moment, the more likely you will be to experience deeper fulfillment.</p><p>Ikigai is a philosophy that reminds us that, with a brief pause, a moment of gratitude for the small things, acceptance for who we are and where we’re at. Then you might end up finding purpose where you never expected it — right in front of you.</p><p>Right here, right now. </p><p><a href=\"https://positivepsychology.com/ikigai/\" target=\"_blank\">If you have any unanswered questions click here, and good luck on your journey!</a></p>",

Most of us have things we'd prefer our fellow passengers do or not do to make the experience better for everyone, however, so <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1281927547301567&amp;id=100064530016648&amp;mibextid=wwXIfr&amp;rdid=VREg45wZSqLfHoZB\" target=\"_blank\">we asked our <em>Upworthy</em> Facebook audience</a>, \"If you could enforce one social rule during flights, what would it be?\" The responses were largely what you might expect and you can see them below, but there was one unexpected comment that stood out. The rule that received the most love, with over 1,200 likes, was this one: </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"dog, flying, airplane, good dog, golden retriever\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"617a0\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk3NjQ2My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NzY0ODQ1Nn0.y0B1z1rARbk1GCb06LtNFBqa250MLDnGPuCRJqJwe_U/img.jpg?width=980\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Can we please get a \"meet the dog\" rule on airplanes?</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos\" target=\"_blank\">Photo credit: Canva</a></small></p><h2>Any dog on the plane has to visit every passenger that requests </h2><p>While not everyone loves dogs, <a href=\"https://www.dvm360.com/view/dogs-rule-cats-drool-americans-prefer-pups\" target=\"_blank\">most people do</a>. And what would make a flight more enjoyable than getting to meet a dog on board? Perhaps we can start a petition to make cabin doggy visits for anyone who wants them an official thing…</p><p>Other responses were helpful reminders of both common courtesy and somewhat standard airplane etiquette for those who might not fly often enough to be familiar with it. In addition to the \"meet the dog\" rule, here are 10 more social rules people wish they could enforce on flights:</p><h4>Be nice to flight attendants</h4><p>Imagine being responsible for both the comfort and safety of 100+ people from different places with different needs in a cabin hurtling through the sky 30,000 feet above the Earth. Flight attendants deal with a wide array of people day in and day out, and we should all make sure we treat them with the kindness and respect that they deserve. </p><h4>Middle seat gets the armrests</h4><p>Nobody should be hogging the armrests, but if anyone has a right to them, it's the sacrificial soul who has to sit in the middle seat. (And window seat controls the window, in case that's not common sense.)</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"headphones, flight, courtesy, airplane etiquette, flying\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"012bd\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk3NjQ4My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgyMjAxOTE5Mn0.qoG3wc4EmWTH6EpUuxgzdiDzXYv99M3sbtOybEIyQpc/img.jpg?width=980\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">No matter your age, headphones to listen to things on a flight are a must.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos\" target=\"_blank\">Photo credit: Canva</a></small></p><h4>Headphones, please</h4><p>No one wants to listen to your video but you. Imagine if everyone listened to movies or YouTube videos or whatever without headphones—total social chaos. In public and on planes, use headphones to listen or watch something. </p><h4>No 'manspreading'</h4><p>We all know the legroom on flights has become practically non-existent, and for people with long legs it can be hard to not bang your knees up against the seat in front of you. But spreading your legs apart so wide that it infringes on other people's leg space just isn't cool. We're all in the same boat, so we have to respect one another's space. </p><h4>Keep your shoes and socks on</h4><p>There may be an exception here for long-haul flights as long as you keep your socks on and don't have stinky feet, but bringing a pair of slippers or something is still courteous. But definitely keep your socks on and be aware that you might not be able to tell if your own feet smell. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"flying, flights, airplane, overhead bin, flight etiquette\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c84ee\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk3NjQ2Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgxNzI1NzQzMn0.nTn3Czb7_SbY_y6zHf4yFP6BlMa7DgwMTZXh_MAZCaQ/img.jpg?width=980\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">One overhead bag per passenger until everyone's got their luggage settled. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos\" target=\"_blank\">Photo credit: Canva</a></small></p><h4>Don’t put a second bag or a jacket in the overhead bin until everyone has put their first bag in</h4><p>Overhead space is limited, so wait until everyone has had a chance to get their carry-on into that space before adding more than your one bag to it. Once everyone's settled in, feel free to add whatever overflow you have.</p><h4>Try not to fart</h4><p>We've all been on a flight where someone let one rip and made everyone's eyes water. Unless you have zero choice in the matter, refrain from dropping gas bombs on your fellow passengers. We're all human and humans fart, but an airplane cabin is a tight spot where people can't get away. At least take it to the lavatory if you can. </p><h4>Be aware of smells in general</h4><p>Come clean and fresh, but not perfumed. Deodorant? Yes, please. Strong cologne or perfume? No. Food that emits a strong odor? Also no. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"flight attendant, safety presentation, airplane safety, seatbelts, courtesy\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"30dc0\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk3NjQ2OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3OTIwNDgwNn0.xBtuHuZWf1wCwitAEzDVcYlFP8MM5Hd8zwv-TYasUTo/img.jpg?width=980\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Even if you know it by heart, please don't talk during the safety demonstration.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos\" target=\"_blank\">Photo credit: Canva</a></small></p><h4>Stay quiet during the safety demonstration</h4><p>Some people fly all the time and could recite the safety demonstration spiel by heart, but that doesn't mean everyone is familiar with it. It only takes a few minutes and first-time flyers need to hear it. It's respectful to the flight attendants to not talk through their presentation and courteous to other passengers who need to listen. </p><h4>Remain seated until it’s your row’s turn to deplane</h4><p>On most flights, as soon as the plane arrives at the gate and the seatbelt sign is turned off, people rush to stand up and gather their luggage. But it's always going to take several minutes to even start getting the first passengers off the plane, and it's not going to go any faster to crowd into the aisle.  </p><p>If we all follow these \"rules,\" flying can be a more pleasant experience for everyone—even our good doggo friends who might be on board. </p>",

Or feel the rush of adrenaline as you engage in a high-speed<a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/86751/fighting-on-ice-hockey-india/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> ice hockey </a>match in the rugged beauty of Ladakh.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With their harsh winters, places like Kashmir and Ladakh transform into breathtaking winter wonderlands. These regions offer a unique canvas for sports that thrive in freezing temperatures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s dive into the rich history and thrilling future of some Indian winter sports, and experience the magic of these icy playgrounds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-ice-skating\">1. Ice skating</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The history of ice skating in Kashmir dates back to the colonial era when British officials, yearning for familiar sports from home, introduced skating to the region. During the biting cold months, when lakes like Dal freeze, the conditions become ideal for ice skating.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whether on the natural ice of Pahalgam&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/302828/best-must-take-winter-treks-in-himalayas-uttarakhand-views-adventure/\">frozen rivers</a>, or the meticulously maintained rinks of Gulmarg, the sport has found a fervent following. The best time to experience ice skating in Kashmir is from December to March when the chill in the air creates the perfect conditions for thick, stable ice.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-ice-skiing\">2. Ice skiing</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Gulmarg is renowned as one of India&rsquo;s premier skiing destinations. The origins of skiing in Gulmarg trace back to 1927, when it was established by British Army officers, Major Metcarp and Major Hadow, who founded the Ski Club of India.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During the pre-independence era, skiing in Gulmarg gained considerable popularity, with the area hosting significant skiing events during Christmas and Easter. The skiing season in Gulmarg generally begins before Christmas and continues until mid-April.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img alt=\"India provides a memorable winter sports experience set against the breathtaking backdrop of snow capped Kashmir, Ladakh and more. \" class=\"wp-image-393984\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/post_attachments/uploads/2024/12/winter-sports-india-1-1735628370.jpg\" style=\"width: 840px; height: auto;\" /><br />\n<figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">India provides a memorable winter sports experience set against the breathtaking backdrop of snow-capped Kashmir, Ladakh, and more. (Representational image)</figcaption>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-sledging\">3. Sledging</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another popular sport to try out in Gulmarg is sledging. Kongdori, particularly, is a popular destination for snow sledging, where locally handcrafted sledges enhance the experience.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other places where snow sledging can be experienced include Solang Valley in Himachal Pradesh and <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/web-stories/snow-in-india-in-march/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Auli in Uttarakhand</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-4-ice-hockey\">4. Ice hockey</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The origins of Ice hockey in Ladakh date back to the 1970s when the Ladakh Scouts Battalion, stationed in the region, innovatively crafted their hockey gear. Using makeshift equipment fashioned from army boots and rubber soles, they laid the foundation for what would become a beloved local tradition.</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"In Ladakh, ice hockey began with army boots and rubber soles. Today, it unites entire communities on frozen rinks each winter.\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/29/winter-sports-india-1735628129-2025-10-29-16-28-42.webp\" style=\"width: 1280px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>In Ladakh, ice hockey began with army boots and rubber soles. Today, it unites entire communities on frozen rinks each winter.</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Established in 1985, the Ladakh Winter Sports Club formalised the sport, organising tournaments and bringing structure to the enthusiastic community. Today, hockey is more than just a game in Ladakh; it is a spectacle that draws men, women, and children onto the ice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-5-speed-skating\">5. Speed skating</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ladakh is also known for its ice skating. A Bird Group enterprise called iSKATE in partnership with The Hockey Foundation (THF), a New York-based non-profit, operates the ice rink in the Chibra Kargyam village situated at an altitude of 14,350 feet above sea level. This 60mx30m ice rink is the <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/132697/winter-sports-ladakh-highest-ice-rink/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">&lsquo;highest&rsquo; ice rink </a>in the world. The ideal time for skating starts from late December to early February.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So, what are you waiting for? Get ready for an unforgettable adventure this winter!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Edited by Aruanava Banerjee</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

It is a gentle and unforgettable encounter with the wild.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Return at dusk to your lodge, where dinner is typically a hearty local spread of rice, lentils, vegetables, and perhaps a mild meat curry, enjoyed in the open air or a rustic dining hall. The evening is best spent beneath a canopy of stars, far from the din of the city, accompanied only by the <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/environment/uttarakhand-van-panchayat-history-collective-of-women-managing-forests-10557653\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sounds of the forest</a>.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Day 2: Into the forest&rsquo;s heart</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The day begins early with a guided safari into Nagarhole National Park, a highlight of any visit to Kabini. Organised by the Karnataka Forest Department, these safaris, priced at Rs 500 to Rs 600 per person for Indian nationals, offer a chance to observe wildlife in its natural habitat.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The forest, a mosaic of deciduous trees, open meadows and winding riverbanks, is home to tigers, leopards, wild dogs, deer, gaur, and an astonishing variety of birds. While sightings are never guaranteed, the anticipation itself is thrilling. Even a quiet morning among trees stirred only by the rustle of leaves is a rare privilege.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Budget trip to Kabini\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/27/budget-trip-to-kabini-2025-10-27-19-33-05.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Upon arrival in Kabini, check into one of the region's modest yet atmospheric accommodations Photograph: </em><a href=\"https://www.thrillophilia.com/kabini-resorts\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>(Thrillophilia)</em></a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After the safari, return to your accommodation for a late breakfast and a morning at leisure. Couples may choose to relax in the shade of their cottage verandah, read, or simply enjoy the peaceful atmosphere. Later in the day,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/travel/eco-tourism-tourism/kids-nature-walks-india-family-travel-outdoors-learning-wildlife-eco-tourism-10534761\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">join a nature walk</a> (typically Rs 200 to Rs 400 per person) led by a local naturalist. These walks explore the quieter aspects of the forest, including native flora, animal tracks, and bird calls, and encourage a slower, more observant way of travelling.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As twilight approaches, you may opt for a second boat ride or rest by the riverbank, watching the sky soften and the forest settle into silence.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Day 3: Farewell to the wilderness</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Spend your final morning on a short village visit or plantation walk, should your lodge offer such excursions (generally Rs 150 to Rs 300 per person). These are immersive experiences that offer a glimpse into the symbiotic relationship between the local communities and the land they inhabit.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Depart Kabini by mid-morning to allow for an unhurried return to Bengaluru. En route, consider stopping in Mysuru for lunch; many reputable establishments serve traditional Karnataka meals for under Rs 400 per couple.</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Budget trip to Kabini\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/27/budget-trip-to-kabini-2025-10-27-19-36-50.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>As the afternoon wanes, enjoy a boat safari along the Kabini River Photograph: </em><a href=\"https://www.vacationindia.com/travelguide/boat-trip-down-the-kabini-river/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>(Vacation India)</em></a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the city skyline reappears, Kabini remains with you as a memory of stillness, of whispered conversations, and of a shared moment in time when the world slowed down.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Estimated budget for two (three days / two nights)</h2>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Travel (self-drive or cab): Rs 2,500 - Rs 4,500</li>\n<li>Accommodation: Rs 4,000 - Rs 8,000</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/452459/wildlife-watching-with-kids-india-guide/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Safari and activities</a>: Rs 2,000 - Rs 3,000</li>\n<li>Meals and additional costs: Rs 1,500 - Rs 2,000</li>\n<li>Total estimated cost for two: Rs 10,000 to Rs 17,000</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kabini is not a place to rush through, but to dwell in.

When he'll actually get to live on it is still a big question, as the build has faced delays and financial hiccups. The ship's sailing date has been pushed out from 2025 to <a href=\"https://www.cruiseind.com/will-storylines-residential-ship-mv-narrative-ever-set-sail/\" target=\"_blank\">a tentative launch in 2027.</a></p><p>The rough math for Wells' dream makes perfect sense on paper, though. He purchased a 12-year lease on the ship for $300,000. That comes to about $2,100 a month if he didn’t have to take out a loan. By comparison, most apartments in San Diego cost <a href=\"https://www.rentcafe.com/average-rent-market-trends/us/ca/san-diego/\" target=\"_blank\">more than $2,100 per month</a> in rent.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"cruise ship, pool on a cruise ship, cruise ship living, cheaper than rent\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e970b\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81ODI1NzM3Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NjgxNDkwM30.olVNvVeVZ3WyQbs4MTvCUMfms5mREMZGBO2rmlePULk/img.jpg?width=980\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Some people call cruise ships home.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqFfX0A8UAc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Photo credit: Canva</a></small></p><p>The ship charges an additional $2,100 a month for all-inclusive services, which include food, drinks, alcohol, gym membership, routine healthcare check-ups, onboard entertainment and laundry.</p><p>So, it could cost Wells as little as $4,200 a month to live an all-expenses-paid life.

After a fire destroyed the local sawmill in 1873, William and his son-in-law Richard Hope added saw equipment and shifted to lumber, which continued until 1966.</p>\n<p>Starting in 2000, the Friends of Hope Mill spent years restoring the machinery, reviving turbines, belts, gears, and saws that hadn’t run for decades. Today, the mill’s 1910 three-sided planer and eight-foot lathe operate again, powered by the original water turbines and wooden gear system.</p>\n<p>Visitors can watch guided demonstrations, tour museum rooms with 19th-century woodworking tools, see the Wool Room, and explore a recreated 1830s bedroom. During live saw floor demonstrations, the full power of the mill is on display. Lumber cut on-site can be purchased, and woodworking courses are offered.</p>",

In exchange for donating a portion of unspoiled, forested land to the Área de Conservación Guanacaste — a nature preserve in the country's northwest — the park would allow the company to dump its discarded orange peels and pulp, free of charge, in a heavily grazed, largely deforested area nearby.</p><p>One year later, one thousand trucks poured into the national park, offloading over 12,000 metric tons of sticky, mealy, orange compost onto the worn-out plot. The site was left untouched and largely unexamined for over a decade. A sign was placed to ensure future researchers could locate and study it.</p><h2>16 years later, Janzen dispatched graduate student Timothy Treuer to look for the site where the food waste was dumped.</h2><p>Treuer initially set out to locate the large placard that marked the plot — and failed.</p><p><br /></p>        <p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"natural wonders, nature, recycling, conservation, environment, oranges, orange peels, dumps\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"db315\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81OTgwNTcxNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgxMzI1MDUyNn0.m40qOB51VQK0enJRDZXCJA9oJ81vGJNdTF0P5wm_7kg/img.jpg?width=980\" />                <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The first deposit of orange peels in 1996.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">                <a href=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8zMjM2MTQwMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0ODQxMzcyN30.I6OisQlQNExFXphdo_3EQsNwG_YTF96gfK7ZViB2mxs/img.jpg?width=980\" target=\"_blank\">Photo by Dan Janzen.</a>        </small>        </p>            <p><br /></p><p>\"It's a huge sign, bright yellow lettering.

Yet for millions of people, purpose feels elusive, like some far-off destination, an epiphany waiting for divine intervention.</p><p>Narratives around living the life of your dreams can package purpose in a very set way, telling stories of a select few who were lucky enough to find their purpose, and never looked back.</p><p>All of these assumptions about purpose make it both intimidating and seemingly unattainable. Factor in cultural ideas of what purpose looks like — from starting a billion-dollar venture in Silicon Valley to living a life in service of the greater good — and you’ll likely be left feeling frustrated, or confused, about how to add purpose to your life.</p><p>Fortunately, these assumptions are misleading. Purpose is much easier to attain than it seems on the surface. And, thankfully, the Japanese concept of ikigai makes discovering your purpose practical. There’s no need to wait for a eureka moment, or yearn for the day purpose will arrive on your doorstep. With ikigai as your own personal Japanese secret, you can start taking deliberate steps to add purpose to your days and inhabit a more happy life. This article will show you how you can start your own personal ikigai journey. Let’s get started!</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-japanese-concept-of-ikigai\">What is the Japanese concept of Ikigai?</h2><p>The best translation for ikigai (pronounced “ee key guy”) is “a reason for being.” The term is formed from the Japanese words iki (life) and gai (worth or benefit).</p><p>Ikigai is central to Japanese culture, with its origin stretching all the way back to the Heian period, a period of classical Japanese history lasting between the years 794 and 1185.</p><p>American researcher Dan Buettner, who presented the popular Ted Talk How to Live to 100, identified ikigai as one of the main factors for greater longevity in Japan. Buettner popularized the concept in the West in the early 2000s.</p><p>Long before then, Japanese psychiatrist Mieko Kamiya, the Mother of Ikigai, wrote one of the most popular modern-day books on the philosophy, Ikigai-ni-Tsuite (What Makes Our Life Worth Living), in 1966. This was around the time early positive psychology was born. Psychologists such as Abraham Maslow, Carl Rogers, and Viktor Frankl shifted the paradigm of psychology away from pathology, and towards what makes for a fulfilling, meaningful life.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Maslow\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"11c35\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/maslow.jpg?id=51945982&amp;width=980\" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"moving-towards-a-more-meaningful-life\">Moving towards a more meaningful life</h3><p>Kamiya herself compared ikigai to Frankl’s approach to meaning. Both were well-versed in how suffering could lead to personal growth. Frankl from his time spent in concentration camps during the Holocaust, and Kamiya worked with leprosy patients. Kamiya described ikigai as:</p><p>“Ikigai means ‘power necessary for one to live in this world, happiness to be alive, benefit, effectiveness.’ When we try to translate it into English, German, French etc, it seems that there is no other way to define it other than ‘worth living’ or ‘value or meaning to live’. Thus, compared to philosophical theoretical concepts, the word ikigai shows us how ambiguous the Japanese language is, but because of this it has an effect of reverberation and amplitude.”</p><p>She acknowledged that “the fact that this word exists should indicate that the goal to live, its meaning and value within the daily life of the Japanese soul has been problematized.” In other words, the word exists because modern-living, to some degree, has disconnected people from their innate sense of purpose, or their soul’s calling.</p><p>Kamiya further defines ikigai into two categories — the source of ikigai, and the state of mind someone feels when connected to the source (ikigai-kan). For Kamiya, ikigai-kan is linked to Frankl’s concept of meaning. In life, a person’s mission is to connect to their mission. Failure to do so can result in depression or anxiety.</p><p>In order to become clear on this mission, Kamiya suggested two questions:</p><ol><li>What is my existence for?</li><li>What is the purpose of my existence?</li></ol><h3 id=\"gaining-clarity\">Gaining Clarity</h3><p>Once clarity is gained, ikigai becomes the North Star that you are guided to. The journey itself is what’s important, not the final destination. Those who are moving towards that North Star experience a sense of fulfillment, ikigai-kan.</p><p>Kamiya was careful to note those pursuing their purpose weren’t always distinguished people — someone can be in service to ikigai when raising children, teaching at schools, or working in medicine. What’s most important is that a person is able to connect to their purpose, and honor it, in whichever way is unique to them.</p><p>For Kamiya, the process of clarifying and honoring their soul’s calling is the discovery of a new theme of existence. For many people, this process could unfold during a spiritual awakening, where their motivations radically transform. For others, it could be a slight, but noticeable change of direction.</p><h2 id=\"ikigai-and-maslow-s-hierarchy-of-needs\">Ikigai and Maslow’s hierarchy of needs</h2><p>In addition to parallels between Frankl’s work on the value of meaning, Kamiya also discovered that to experience ikigai-kan, someone must first have several personal needs met. The result is a similar model of thinking to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, which outlines the journey of growth and self-actualization.</p><p>The needs Kamiya identified are:</p><p>The need for life satisfaction<br />The need for change and growth<br />The need for a bright future<br />The need for resonance<br />The need for freedom<br />The need for self-actualization<br />The need for meaning and value</p><p>These closely resemble Maslow’s pyramid of physiological needs, safety needs, love and belonging, esteem, self-actualization, and self-transcendence (the often forgotten additional layer). It’s worth keeping in mind, though, that Maslow noted for some, lower levels can be transcended by higher values, such as creativity being more important than safety needs or esteem.</p><p>The same can be said of ikigai — if your mission or purpose is something greater than you, it’s likely that it can overshadow other personal needs and contribute to well being.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-ikigai-important-for-a-fulfilling-life\">Why is Ikigai important for a fulfilling life?</h2><p>As Buettner discovered, meaning is one of the most influential factors in living a long and healthy life, both for younger generations and those that are older. Buettner has researched so-called Blue Zones, the locations where people lived for longer and enjoyed greater wellbeing.</p><p>Five locations Buettner discovered were Okinawa, Japan; Sardinia, Italy; Nicoya, Costa Rica; Ikaria, Greece, and Loma Linda, California. He noticed that these five locations placed a lot of emphasis on meaning and purpose.</p><p>This has been backed up by multiple studies. A 2014 UCL-led study of 9,000 people with an average age of 65 found that those with a greater sense of meaning and purpose were 30 percent less likely to die in the following eight-year period. More recently in 2019, a study of 7,000 people over the age of 50 found “life purpose was significantly associated with all-cause mortality.” So much so, the lowest scorers of the study were twice as likely to have died than those with the highest scores five years later.</p><h3 id=\"the-power-of-ikigai\">The power of ikigai</h3><p>Noriyuki Nakashi, from Osaka University, explains the power of ikigai as:</p><p>“Ikigai is personal: it reflects the inner self of an individual and expresses that faithfully.<br />Ikigai, which is the highest level of desire, may be considered to be essentially the process of cultivating one’s inner potential and that which makes one's life significant, a universal human experience we all wish to achieve.”</p><p>Purpose gives you a deeper reason for living, it makes your life significant. As noted by thinkers such as Kamiya and Frankl, there is an interesting component to this — it appears, deep down, each of us has a purpose that we intuitively know and understand. Our mission is to listen to that calling and do all we can to honor it, in order to cultivate our inner potential.</p><p>Longevity is a byproduct of doing something right. Purpose gives you the energy and inspiration to pursue your goals, overcome struggle, and keep going when times are tough. It provides strong foundations of fulfillment and can give your life a new direction, not towards fleeting happiness, but towards things of high value. In the words of Oscar Wilde: “To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.”</p><h2 id=\"understanding-the-ikigai-chart-and-your-own-ikigai-journey\">Understanding the Ikigai chart and your own ikigai journey</h2><p>Are you ready for your mind to be blown by ikigai, the Japanese secret that so many swear by? For your understanding of ikigai to take a drastic u-turn into a new theme of existence? The ikigai venn diagram, shared by millions and rising to meme-like popularity on social media, isn’t linked to ikigai. Instead, it was an idea from Marc Winn, an entrepreneur and blogger who merged the idea of ikigai with a venn diagram of purpose.</p><p>Winn was introduced to the concept of ikigai and the ikigai diagram from Buettner’s Ted Talk. “I don’t know whether to laugh or cry,” he wrote in 2017, “less than an hour of my time has made more of a difference in the world than all my time put together.”</p><p>Winn acknowledges his own surprise that his idea, and the diagram, spiraled out of control. The diagram is shown below:</p><img alt=\"Ikigai: The True Meaning with Diagrams, Definitions, &amp; Myths | Sloww\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"52525\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/ikigai-the-true-meaning-with-diagrams-definitions-myths-sloww.jpg?id=51945986&amp;width=980\" /><p>While the venn diagram is incredibly useful, there’s one major downside — the true meaning of ikigai isn’t about making money. The diagram might be valuable in understanding how you can launch a career of meaning, but in many ways, it’s the result of ikigai running through the money-oriented worldview of the West.<br />In fact, a 2010 study of 2,000 people in Japan found that only a third saw work as their ikigai. In addition, the Japanese translation of life means both your lifespan, and everyday life. This leads to another possible misinterpretation — ikigai can be discovered in the simple, day-to-day joys of living, not a grandiose plan or life mission worthy of Hollywood fame. It’s a spectrum of joy, from the seemingly mundane to the miraculous, and everything between.</p><h2 id=\"the-five-pillars-of-ikigai\">The five pillars of ikigai</h2><p>So if the ikigai isn’t discovered through a venn diagram, how do you apply the concept to your life? In The Little Book of Ikigai, Japanese neuroscientist and author Ken Mogi offers a five-pillar framework. By following this framework, you’re able to cultivate the type of lifestyle that allows for the emergence of ikigai:</p><h3 id=\"pillar-one-start-small\">Pillar One: Start Small</h3><p>Discovering a new theme of existence begins with small steps. That could be as simple as making the inner commitment to start creating a life of enhanced purpose.</p><p>What changes could you make, today, to start that process? Is there a passion, or calling, that you sense on the periphery of your awareness? What could you do in order to start honoring that? Remember, purpose doesn’t have to be elaborate or grand.</p><p>Applying Kamiya’s work, you could journal and answer the two questions: what is my existence for? What is the purpose of my existence? Don’t think about it too much, just see what surfaces.</p><p>Additionally, consider what things in life are the source of ikigai, or when are the moments when you feel ikigai-kan. For me, writing is the source of both. Although now established as a writer, in the beginning, it started with a commitment to write a little every day.</p><h3 id=\"pillar-two-releasing-yourself\">Pillar Two: Releasing Yourself</h3><p>This pillar demonstrates how deep the philosophy of ikigai is, and its entanglement with other Eastern philosophies that have stood the test of time, such as Buddhism. </p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Buddhism\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"baf83\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/buddhism.jpg?id=51946000&amp;width=980\" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure><p>Releasing yourself means to let go of all the things in life you hold onto, that cause some form of suffering.</p><p>It’s similar to the Buddhist practices of non-attachment. Are you attached to your self-image, what other people think of you, or always thinking about a time you’ll finally be happy?</p><p>Releasing yourself requires accepting where you’re at, who you are, and the moment in front of you. It leads to a state of peaceful surrender, going with the flow, rather than grappling with life.</p><p>Ikigai is, after all, a practice of aligning with nature. “The greatest secret of the ikigai, ultimately, has to be the acceptance of oneself, no matter what kind of unique features one might happen to be born with,” Mogi writes.</p><h3 id=\"pillar-three-harmony-and-sustainability\">Pillar Three: Harmony and Sustainability</h3><p>This step is connected to your environment. Ikigai incorporates the people in our lives, our immediate community, the quality and sustainability of all living things we interact with.</p><p>As Mogi says, “A man is like a forest; individual and yet connected and dependent on others for growth.” Harmony and sustainability are both inner and outer experiences, reflected in your emotions, your thoughts, the way you interact with the world, the way you go about your work.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"a man is like a forest\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c07ba\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/a-man-is-like-a-forest.jpg?id=51945983&amp;width=980\" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure><p>Consider any area of life where there is disharmony. Perhaps you have a few relationships that cause friction, or you are pushing yourself to extremes, unable to sustain that approach to hustle culture for the long term. In what ways can you invite a more peaceful approach? How can you be the source of harmony, for yourself, and for the wider world around you?</p><p>That doesn’t have to mean being half-hearted in what you do, quite the opposite, as ikigai encourages commitment and passion in equal measure. But make sure not to fall into traps of seriousness, and keep an explorative, playful attitude to yourself, your relationships, your community, and your work.</p><h3 id=\"pillar-four-the-joy-of-little-things\">Pillar Four: The Joy of Little Things</h3><p>Ikigai is a comprehensive philosophy, as well as being an antidote to a lot of modern approaches to finding happiness through constant striving, or the craving for success or recognition.</p><p>Deeply embedded in the Japanese concept is finding joy in little things. Your morning coffee. A smile from a stranger. An unexpected spell of sunshine. A message from a friend you’ve not spoken to in a while. A delicious sip of energizing green tea. All of these are opportunities to enjoy small sparks of joy, sparks that pave the way for a life in honor of ikigai.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"green tea\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b96f5\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/green-tea.jpg?id=51945998&amp;width=980\" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure><p>As Kamiya notes, those dedicated to ikigai spend all their days in fulfillment. Yes, there might be a challenging process of realizing your calling, and adjusting your life to make sure you have supreme focus on fulfilling your potential. But ikigai isn’t about the end destination, it’s about smelling the flowers on the way.</p><p>The easiest way to do this is to look for gratitude in your life. What things bring you a sense of comfort? What in your life would you have never predicted or thought you’d be able to achieve? What have you overcome? Who adds laughter or who supports you? All of these reflections of gratitude support the feeling of ikigai-kan.</p><h3 id=\"h-pillar-five-being-in-the-here-and-now\">Pillar Five: Being in the Here and Now</h3><p>To reaffirm the intention of ikigai, and its link to mindfulness, the final pillar reminds us to be present. To pause. To become fully aware of what’s directly in front of us. To take things one step at a time, and notice when our minds get caught in the past, or jump ahead to the future. The more present you become, the richer life is, the more nourishing each moment, and the less fearful you become about uncertain futures.</p><p>The irony of trying to find happiness is that it keeps us always looking ahead, waiting for a moment to come. But as many Eastern philosophies have taught, that is an illusion. Only the present ever exists. And the more you’re able to truly arrive in the present moment, the more likely you will be to experience deeper fulfillment.</p><p>Ikigai is a philosophy that reminds us that, with a brief pause, a moment of gratitude for the small things, acceptance for who we are and where we’re at. Then you might end up finding purpose where you never expected it — right in front of you.</p><p>Right here, right now. </p><p><a href=\"https://positivepsychology.com/ikigai/\" target=\"_blank\">If you have any unanswered questions click here, and good luck on your journey!</a></p>",

In these discarded leaves lies a gift for your garden; they are a natural, free, and potent fertiliser waiting to be unlocked. Leaf mulching is an art as much as it is a science, turning what most people consider waste into a treasure trove for healthy soil.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Imagine walking into your balcony or small garden in early winter, noticing that the beds are covered with a soft, earthy layer of leaves. Beneath this blanket, the soil is quietly changing, retaining moisture, suppressing weeds, and nurturing life from the tiniest microbe to your beloved plants.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The magic of leaf mulching lies not in complicated machinery or chemical concoctions but in a patient rhythm with nature.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why your garden will thank you</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Leaves are nature&rsquo;s own compost packets. As they break down, they release essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium into the soil. The organic matter improves soil structure, encourages beneficial microorganisms, and creates a spongy layer that holds water during dry spells.

It is a practice that supports not just plants, but a sense of connection to the natural world.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">How to start your leaf mulch journey</h2>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Collect with care</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Begin with a <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/gardening/october-pruning-guide-indian-gardens-pruning-trees-shrubs-maintenance-home-gardening-tricks-10590306\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">walk around your garden</a>, terrace, or nearby neighbourhood. Gather fallen leaves, choosing those that are healthy and free from disease. If some are damp or curled, don&rsquo;t worry, they will still decompose, though shredding them first speeds up the process. For urban gardeners, a pair of scissors or a lawnmower can turn bulky leaves into manageable pieces.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Shredding: The secret to quick decomposition</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shredded leaves fit snugly around your plants and also decompose faster. Picture them as puzzle pieces; the smaller the pieces, the faster they integrate into the soil. This simple step turns a pile of leaves into a living, breathing layer of humus.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Layer leaves to feed your soil</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Spread a modest layer of shredded leaves, about two to three inches, over the soil. Avoid over-piling; think of it as tucking your garden in for winter. Lightly mixing the leaves with the top layer of soil encourages microbial activity, and over time, these tiny gardeners will turn the leaves into dark and crumbly goodness.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. Water and nurture</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After laying down the mulch, give it a gentle watering. This simple act helps settle the leaves, kickstarts decomposition, and <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/farming/restore-soil-after-monsoon-natural-soil-recharging-compost-soil-fertility-healthy-crops-post-rains-10507957\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">keeps the soil moist</a>. Over the weeks, continue to add new leaves as the old layer breaks down, creating a mulch that evolves with the seasons.</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"leaf mulching healthy garden\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/leaf-mulching-healthy-garden-2025-10-28-17-33-05.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Leaves are nature&rsquo;s own compost packets.

Boosting your mulch&nbsp;</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For gardeners seeking a faster modification, a thin sprinkling of compost or kitchen vegetable scraps over the leaves creates a nutrient-rich cocktail. The leaves become a living ecosystem, feeding your plants and the microorganisms that support them.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lessons from the leaves</h2>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Fallen leaves are far from waste; they are nature&rsquo;s own fertiliser.</li>\n<li>Shredding is the secret ingredient to quick and effective mulching.</li>\n<li>A modest, well-maintained layer protects and <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/490257/scientist-shitarashmi-sahu-transforms-rourkela-steel-industry-slag-waste-into-fertiliser/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">enriches your soil naturally</a>.</li>\n<li>Combining leaves with compost or kitchen scraps accelerates nutrient release.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"leaf mulching healthy garden\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/leaf-mulching-healthy-garden-2025-10-28-17-37-10.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Shredding is the secret ingredient to quick and effective mulching.

The triumph lies not in picking the produce, but in knowing how to preserve it, so its flavours and vitality survive through winter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With practical methods that combine time-honoured wisdom and easy household solutions, you can turn your fall harvest into a pantry treasure trove. This guide will walk you through the nuances of harvesting and storing your garden&rsquo;s bounty:</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Knowing when to harvest</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Harvesting at the right moment is essential. Crops left in the soil too long risk losing freshness and flavour, while picking too early may mean sacrificing quality and storability.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">For root vegetables like carrots, radishes and sweet potatoes, observe their shoulders protruding slightly above the soil; they should feel firm and well-developed.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/259690/how-to-home-garden-aurangabad-organic-vegetables-facebook/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Leafy greens</a> should be picked when leaves have reached full size but remain tender and bright.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fruits such as guavas, pomegranates, and other fall crops are ripe when their skin is dark-coloured, firm, and gives slightly under gentle pressure.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"harvesting and storing autumn crops\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/harvesting-and-storing-autumn-crops-2025-10-28-22-01-12.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Fruits such as guavas, pomegranates, and other fall crops are ripe when their skin is dark-coloured and can be harvested.

Dry conditions at harvest reduce moisture that could otherwise invite premature spoilage or mould growth.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Gentle harvesting preserves freshness</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The way you handle your produce post-harvest influences its shelf life. Bruises or cuts create entry points for decay.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Use sharp, clean tools such as garden knives or scissors to cut produce cleanly from the plant.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Avoid washing freshly harvested crops immediately; instead, gently brush away any soil. Washing can add unwelcome moisture, encouraging rot.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Place vegetables and fruits in shallow trays or baskets, avoiding heaping them into piles that could crush delicate produce.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Taking a little extra care now pays dividends in preserving quality for weeks or even months to come.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Creating the perfect storage environment at home</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many gardeners believe refrigeration is necessary for storing harvests, but with the right conditions, many crops can be kept fresh without it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Select a cool, dark, and dry space, such as a cellar, storeroom, or a shaded balcony, that remains well ventilated. Temperatures between 10&deg;C and 15&deg;C are ideal.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Root vegetables, such as potatoes, <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/250476/kerala-wayanad-organic-farmer-c-v-verghese-terrace-gardening-how-to-grow-organic-vegetables-vertical-mesh-tower-method-ros174/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">carrots, and sweet potatoes</a>, keep best when stored in boxes or crates layered with dry sand or sawdust. This helps maintain moisture balance, keeping them firm and crisp.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Leafy greens have a shorter lifespan but can be preserved by wrapping loosely in a damp muslin cloth and storing in the coolest part of the house or refrigerator for short-term use.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"harvesting and storing autumn crops\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/harvesting-and-storing-autumn-crops-2025-10-28-22-04-36.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Root vegetables, such as potatoes, carrots, and sweet potatoes, keep best when stored in boxes.

Traditional storage techniques for gardeners</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many time-tested methods from rural traditions remain invaluable for today&rsquo;s gardeners:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Evaporative cooling chambers, crafted from two nested clay pots with moist sand in between, create a natural cooling effect that prolongs freshness.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hanging dried vegetables and fruits in breathable cloth bags keeps produce away from pests and encourages airflow, preventing mould.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Storing pulses, grains and dried goods in earthenware pots lined with neem leaves acts as a natural insect repellent and maintains dryness.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These low-cost techniques can be replicated at home with materials readily available in most households.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Preparing crops for long-term storage</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Proper preparation is essential for extending shelf life:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Curing tubers like sweet potatoes involves keeping them in a warm, dry, airy place for several days. This thickens their skins, protecting them against rot.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Blanching leafy greens, briefly immersing them in boiling water before plunging into cold water, halts enzyme action that causes spoilage and helps retain colour and nutrients.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sun-drying slices of fruits and vegetables concentrates flavours and preserves them naturally. Make sure they are fully dry before storing in airtight containers to avoid mould.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Protecting your harvest: Pest and spoilage prevention</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even with excellent storage, vigilance is important:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Use <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/478831/monsoon-vegetable-garden-pest-control-tips-gardening-organic-solutions/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">natural repellents such as neem leaves</a>, dried chillies or garlic cloves placed among your stored crops to deter insects.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Inspect your stored produce regularly, removing any items showing signs of spoilage before they affect the rest.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Keep storage areas well ventilated to avoid the build-up of humidity, a common cause of mould and decay.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"harvesting and storing autumn crops\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/harvesting-and-storing-autumn-crops-2025-10-28-22-10-04.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Use natural repellents such as neem leaves, dried chillies or garlic cloves to deter pests.

This transitional period, characterised by cooler days and moderate humidity, creates ideal conditions for off-season farming.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For small-scale farmers, it presents a valuable opportunity to grow high-demand vegetables that command premium prices, while maximising land use and building a steady source of income.</p>\n<h2>Best vegetables to cultivate in autumn</h2>\n<h3>1. Spinach</h3>\n<p>Spinach is a nutrient-dense leafy vegetable that flourishes in the cool and moist conditions of autumn. Its rapid growth cycle of approximately 25 to 30 days means it can provide a quick return and multiple harvests in one season. Rich in iron and vitamins, it enjoys year-round demand in both households and markets.</p>\n<p><strong>How to grow:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prepare well-drained, fertile soil enriched with organic compost to retain moisture yet avoid waterlogging.</li>\n<li>Sow seeds thinly at about one centimetre depth directly into the soil beds.</li>\n<li>Water regularly every two to three days, making sure the soil remains moist but not soggy.</li>\n<li>Once seedlings reach a few centimetres in height, thin them to allow five to seven centimetres spacing for healthy leaf development.</li>\n<li>Harvest outer leaves carefully to encourage continuous regrowth, allowing multiple pickings over several weeks.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Off-season farming\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/off-season-farming-2025-10-28-14-15-34.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Spinach is a nutrient-dense leafy vegetable that flourishes in the cool conditions.

Fenugreek</h3>\n<p>Fenugreek, valued both as a <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/259690/how-to-home-garden-aurangabad-organic-vegetables-facebook/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">leafy vegetable</a> and for its medicinal qualities, prospers in autumn&rsquo;s moderate temperatures. It grows rapidly and requires minimal inputs, making it ideal for small farmers. Its distinctive aroma and flavour make it a staple in many kitchens.</p>\n<p><strong>How to grow:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Broadcast seeds evenly over well-tilled soil and lightly cover with a thin layer of earth.</li>\n<li>Maintain consistent moisture by watering gently every alternate day.</li>\n<li>Germination usually occurs within seven days.</li>\n<li>Cut the leaves about two centimetres above the base after 20 to 25 days to allow for regrowth and multiple harvests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. Radish</h3>\n<p>Radish is a fast-growing root vegetable that matures within 30 to 40 days, surviving in the cool and gentle conditions of autumn. Its crisp texture and peppery flavour make it a favourite, while its quick turnaround makes it a profitable choice.</p>\n<p><strong>How to grow:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Select loose, sandy or loamy soil to facilitate unrestricted root growth.</li>\n<li>Sow seeds directly in shallow rows, about one centimetre deep, spacing seeds two to three centimetres apart.</li>\n<li>Once seedlings sprout, thin them to five centimetres spacing to allow room for bulb development.</li>\n<li>Keep soil moist consistently, avoiding waterlogging to prevent rot.</li>\n<li>Harvest roots when they are tender and firm, before they become woody and overly pungent.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4. Carrot</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/496839/punjab-farmer-phuman-singh-carrot-farming-earns-crores/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Carrots, prized for their sweetness</a> and crunch, perform exceptionally well in autumn&rsquo;s cooler climate, which enhances their flavour. Although carrots require a longer growing period of 60 to 70 days, the resulting crop commands strong market prices.</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Off-season farming\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/off-season-farming-2025-10-28-14-18-35.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Harvest carrots when roots reach the desired size and firmness.

Coriander</h3>\n<p>Coriander is a fragrant herb essential to many culinary traditions and grows swiftly during autumn. Both the fresh leaves and seeds are valued, providing dual harvest potential.</p>\n<p><strong>How to grow:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lightly crush seeds before sowing to improve germination rates.</li>\n<li>Sow thinly in well-drained soil beds and cover seeds lightly.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/477793/self-watering-planter-osmos-gowtham-reddy-hyderabad/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Water gently every day</a> or two to keep the soil moist.</li>\n<li>Thin seedlings to five centimetres apart to avoid overcrowding.</li>\n<li>Leaves can be harvested within three to four weeks; allow some plants to flower and produce seeds for a later harvest.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>6. Cauliflower</h3>\n<p>Cauliflower is a cool-season crop that develops best in autumn when temperatures are mild. It is prized for its firm, white curds and commands premium prices, particularly during off-season periods.</p>\n<p><strong>How to grow:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start seedlings in a nursery for three to four weeks to certify strong and healthy plants.</li>\n<li>Prepare raised beds with fertile, well-draining soil and transplant seedlings at 45 to 60 cm spacing.</li>\n<li>Provide ample sunlight and maintain consistent moisture with regular watering.</li>\n<li>Apply organic fertilisers, such as well-rotted manure or compost tea, to encourage robust growth.</li>\n<li>Protect developing curds from harsh sunlight by loosely tying outer leaves over the heads if needed to prevent yellowing.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Off-season farming\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/off-season-farming-2025-10-28-14-25-59.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Cauliflower is a cool-season crop that develops best in autumn.

Among the most rewarding to sow now are peas and beans.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They are unassuming little seeds that promise abundance, nourishment and a touch of rustic elegance to any garden. Brimming with natural protein and dynamism, these verdant climbers are as pleasing to the eye as they are to the palate.</p>\n<h2>The charm of Autumn sowing</h2>\n<p>Autumn&rsquo;s mild climate and softened sunlight create the ideal conditions for peas and beans. The soil remains pliant and rich from the monsoon&rsquo;s generosity, while cooler days favour strong and steady growth. This balance of warmth and freshness helps seeds germinate swiftly and plants flourish without the stress of scorching heat.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Choose your varieties wisely</h3>\n<p>The secret to a flourishing crop lies in the seed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Peas: Choose quick-growing types such as garden peas, snow peas or sugar snaps. These survive in temperate weather and offer a sweet and tender yield.</li>\n<li>Beans: Opt for French beans if you prefer compact bushes, or runner beans if you fancy elegant climbers that drape beautifully along a trellis.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Sowing peas and beans\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/sowing-peas-and-beans-2025-10-28-18-31-12.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Autumn&rsquo;s mild climate and softened sunlight create the ideal conditions for peas and beans.

Peas and beans prosper in friable, <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/446695/grow-amla-in-pots-container-gardening-indian-gooseberry-gardening-steps-grow-in-compact-spaces/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fertile soil with excellent drainage</a>. Loosen the soil to a depth of about 20 to 25 centimetres and blend in generous amounts of compost or well-rotted manure. Though legumes enrich the earth by fixing nitrogen, they still appreciate a nutrient-rich start.</p>\n<p>Avoid recently used plots where other legumes grew; the soil may harbour pests or depleted elements that could stunt new plants.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Sow with care</h3>\n<p>Sow once the harsh sun has mellowed and the soil feels comfortably warm to the touch.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Peas: Plant seeds two to three centimetres deep, leaving about five centimetres between each.</li>\n<li>Beans: Set them slightly deeper, around three to four centimetres, with 15 to 20 centimetres between plants and roughly half a metre between rows.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your soil tends to retain water, create raised beds to keep the roots from drowning. A moist, not soggy, surface is ideal for germination.</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Sowing peas and beans\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/sowing-peas-and-beans-2025-10-28-18-36-28.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Choose quick-growing types such as garden peas, snow peas, or sugar snaps for better yield. Photograph: </em><a href=\"https://www.koppert.in/crops/arable-crops/pea/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>(Koppert India)</em></a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>Step 4: Provide sturdy support</h3>\n<p>Peas and climbing beans are natural adventurers; give them something to ascend. Bamboo poles, garden netting or wooden frames make excellent supports. Setting these up at the time of sowing <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/466731/monsoon-gardening-tips-india-rainy-season-vegetable-garden-care-how-to-take-care-of-plants/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">prevents damage to tender roots</a> later. Bush beans, by contrast, remain neat and upright, needing no assistance beyond good spacing.</p>\n<h3>Step 5: Water thoughtfully</h3>\n<p>Consistency in watering is crucial. Keep the soil evenly moist, especially during flowering and pod formation. Water early in the morning to allow leaves to dry through the day, reducing the risk of fungal disease. A mulch of straw or dry leaves will conserve moisture and suppress unwelcome weeds.</p>\n<h3>Step 6: Feed and protect</h3>\n<p>Although peas and beans are self-reliant, a mild organic feed at the onset of flowering can enhance their yield. Watch for aphids or leaf miners; a natural neem spray or gentle soap solution will deter them effectively. <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/429250/grow-lychee-at-home-indian-cities-home-gardening-steps-climate-soil-lychee-cultivation/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Good airflow and sunlight</a> are the simplest guardians against most ailments.</p>\n<h3>Step 7: Harvest at their prime</h3>\n<p>The joy of harvesting lies in timing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Peas: Pick when pods are plump yet tender, before the seeds harden.</li>\n<li>Beans: Gather when they are slender and firm but still supple to the touch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Harvest regularly because the more you pick, the more the plant produces.</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Sowing peas and beans\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/28/sowing-peas-and-beans-2025-10-28-18-39-55.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Peas and beans prosper in friable, fertile soil with excellent drainage.

Their roots hold nitrogen that <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/490257/scientist-shitarashmi-sahu-transforms-rourkela-steel-industry-slag-waste-into-fertiliser/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">enriches the soil</a> naturally. Turn the remaining foliage into compost or gently mix it into the bed to prepare for your next planting.</p>\n<h2>Essential takeaways for a flourishing autumn garden</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Start early:</strong> Sow as soon as the days begin to cool.</li>\n<li><strong>Seek sunlight:</strong> Peas and beans need at least five hours of direct light each day.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep soil moist:</strong> Never let it dry out completely.</li>\n<li><strong>Support climbers:</strong> A trellis or pole structure supports healthy growth.</li>\n<li><strong>Feed organically:</strong> <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/sustainability/puja-waste-at-home-easy-tips-to-turn-flowers-leftover-food-into-compost-for-home-garden-10502428\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rely on compost</a> rather than chemical fertilisers.</li>\n<li><strong>Harvest often:</strong> Regular picking promotes steady production.</li>\n</ul>",

Gabon as well as the Republic of Congo is a stronghold for the central chimp, found across <span><a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/15936/102332276\">more than 700,000 square kilometres of Central Africa</a></span>. Relying primarily on ripe fruits but also <span><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10329-020-00885-4.pdf\">occasionally hunting mammals</a></span> such as monkeys and duikers, central chimps have been the subject of productive research in Gabon, where, for example, the apes have been recorded <span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/08/chimpanzees-observed-treating-wounds-of-others-using-crushed-insects\">tending to wounds with crushed insects</a></span> and, in Loango National Park, conducting <span><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93829-x.pdf\">coordinated attacks on groups of western lowland gorillas</a></span> and killing infant gorillas.<span> </span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tool use—for example, <span><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ghislain-Ella/publication/263016202_Use_of_tool_sets_by_chimpanzees_for_multiple_purposes_in_Moukalaba-Doudou_National_Park_Gabon/links/5d4960ff92851cd046a5a517/Use-of-tool-sets-by-chimpanzees-for-multiple-purposes-in-Moukalaba-Doudou-National-Park-Gabon.pdf\">using sticks for pounding honeycombs, extracting honey, and probing logs in search of prey</a></span>—has been recorded among chimps in Gabon’s Loango and Moukalaba-Doudou national parks. Now, this newly released camera-trap footage shows it’s also a skill practiced on the Batéké Plateau.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The use of a stick to investigate the trail camera is also an intriguing behaviour that wasn’t noted in a <span><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982219301630#sec1\">2019 survey</a></span> of the responses of naive African apes—chimps, bonobos, and gorillas—to camera traps. While the researchers in that study predicted that chimps would display the most curiosity toward camera traps on account of their more diverse diet and habitat preferences, in fact it was the bonobos and gorillas that “demonstrated a stronger looking impulse toward the camera trap device compared to chimpanzees, suggesting higher visual attention and curiosity.”</p>\n<figure>\n            <p>\n                    <img alt=\"chimpanzee-cameratrap-bw_2025-06-13.jpg\" src=\"https://www.earthtouchnews.com/media/1955731/chimpanzee-cameratrap-bw_2025-06-13.jpg?mode=crop&amp;width=1060&amp;height=707\" />\n                <br /><figcaption>Research shows that it's actually bonobos and gorillas that demonstrate a stronger impulse to investigate camera trap devices compared to chimps. Image © <a href=\"https://panthera.org/blog-post/candid-wildlife-moments-caught-camera-gabons-bateke-plateau\" target=\"_blank\">Panthera/Gabon ANPN</a></figcaption>\n            </p>\n        </figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The study authors speculated that possibly the remote cameras simply didn’t provoke enough excitement or fear in chimps to warrant close interest. Of the three ape species, bonobos showed the most fearful responses to the camera traps—a reflection, perhaps, of the more egalitarian bonobo society, where the “allocation of risk is predicted to be spread more evenly within the group” as compared to chimps and gorillas, where one or a handful of individuals serve as leaders.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chimps—classified as Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)—and western lowland gorillas (Critically Endangered) are among a number of primate species recorded in Batéké Plateau National Park, also home to several kinds of monkey—from moustached monkeys and northern talapoins to mandrills, first documented in a <span><a href=\"https://www.eva.mpg.de/documents/Wiley-Blackwell/Hedwig_Camera_AfrJEco_2018_2573546.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2017 camera-trapping survey</a></span>—as well as pottos and galagos.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The park lies in southeastern Gabon and encompasses a striking landscape of ecological frontiers. It marks where the northwestern edge of the Batéké Plateau itself—a highland of sandstone and ancient sand dunes that sprawls across some six million hectares of Gabon, Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Angola—subsides to the great low-lying Gabonese rainforest. The Plateau, which includes domes and escarpments cut by rolling foothills and river valleys, harbours extensive tracts of grassland and savannah, with gallery forests—some of which finger into the highland from the bordering rainforest—threaded through as lusher ribbons of tall trees and dense understory.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A local manifestation of the extensive Western Congolian Forest-Savanna Mosaic, the Batéké’s blend of grassy glades and parkland intermixed with riverine forest makes for a fascinating faunal mashup. Here, historically, lions, spotted hyenas, waterbuck, and other savannah and woodland species shared the greater landscape with rainforest denizens such as forest elephants, forest buffalo, forest duikers, sitatunga, and red river hogs—and, of course, those two great apes (though chimps in places can be savannah-dwellers).</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Camera-trap surveys undertaken around when the park was established in 2004 and subsequently have made some major discoveries, not least (thanks to camera traps set up for chimps) the presence of a male lion in 2015 (which we reported on <span><a href=\"https://www.earthtouchnews.com/conservation/conservation/camera-trap-footage-sparks-hope-for-a-lion-comeback-in-gabon/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></span> and <span><a href=\"https://www.earthtouchnews.com/conservation/conservation/take-two-gabons-lone-lion-makes-another-on-camera-appearance/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></span>): the first well-documented observation in Gabon since 1996. <span><a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6448349/\">Genetic analysis of hair samples gathered from this lion</a></span> suggested it may have been a holdout of the so-called Batéké lions that formerly seemed to specialise in this savannah/woodland country rather than a disperser from West/Central African prides in Cameroon or the Central African Republic, separated from Gabon by dense rainforest.</p>\n<hr class=\"related-link\" />\n    <div class=\"related-more\">\n        <span>\n            Read more:\n            <a href=\"https://www.earthtouchnews.com/conservation/conservation/camera-trap-footage-sparks-hope-for-a-lion-comeback-in-gabon\">\n\t\t\tCamera trap footage sparks hope for a lion comeback in Gabon\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</a>\n        </span>\n    </div>\n    <hr class=\"related-link\" />\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, the trailcam investigated by the chimp was part of an effort by ANPN and Panthera to monitor for big cats in the park, and, <span><a href=\"https://panthera.org/blog-post/candid-wildlife-moments-caught-camera-gabons-bateke-plateau\">according to Panthera</a></span>, happened to be in the same area where the 2015 lion was documented.

In this moment, I felt a little frustrated by the antiquated instruction from the teacher, but I responded saying, “Well that’s silly. There are no good foods or bad foods. Food is just food!“  I will say, this was not my internal dialogue growing up, but because of the information that I have from so many great accounts created by moms and experts, in the field of childhood and nutrition, I am armed with better responses, knowledge and practices for my kids.  Three years old. At three years old someone has told her that foods are good or bad. I am so proud that she had sensed something was off -  to know that was not right enough to tell me about it. We talk about it all the time at home… If you only eat carrots or broccoli your body won’t have protein it needs to grow strong muscles.

Modern science has recently begun to explore these beliefs, and better understand their properties and benefits at a much higher level.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>Ginkgo Biloba is Over 200 Million Years Old</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Since its discovery, the “living fossil” has been a centerpiece of human medicine. It is the plant that survived the dinosaurs and has been revered for its medicinal properties since discovered. The potential of benefiting memory and cognitive function <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3166615/\" target=\"_blank\">continues to be reinforced by research</a>. Ginkgo Biloba is rich in flavonoids and terpenoids that help combat oxidative stress, improving blood flow to the brain and protecting against neurodegenerative disorders.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>Lion's Mane Mushrooms and Neural Networks</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The Lion's Mane mushroom has had an almost viral ascent over the past decade. This mushroom has been used traditionally in Chinese medicine; and has compounds that stimulate the production of nerve growth factors. Preliminary studies suggest it may support brain health by promoting neuronal growth, reducing inflammation, and defending against<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8232141/\" target=\"_blank\"> neurodegenerative diseases.</a></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>Ashwagandha and Adaptogenic Properties</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>An ancient Ayurvedic tradition, Ashwagandha has become a modern staple for people worldwide. It has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, as it's rich in withanolides. Ashwagandha is believed to help protect cells from free radicals, by utilizing its adaptogenic properties. Emerging studies have also hinted at Ashwagandhas's <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378874119339182\" target=\"_blank\">potential for neural growth</a> and even to combat the symptoms of anxiety and depression.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2>The Top 5 Underappreciated Superfoods</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In the realm of cognitive function, polyphenols play a crucial role in combating oxidative stress, supporting neural communication, and fostering brain plasticity. They are naturally occurring compounds found predominantly in plants and are revered for their high antioxidant capacity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Here is a short list of 5 underappreciated and less talked about superfoods that’ll give you the polyphenol boost you need:</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>Green Tea</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Long venerated in Asian cultures as a beverage, in ceremony, and in daily practice, green tea is packed with catechins, antioxidants that traverse the blood-brain barrier, <a href=\"https://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/10-super-foods-to-boost-your-daily-productivity-and-health/\">enhancing cognitive function</a>. Green tea also contains a modest amount of caffeine, which, in tandem with its L-theanine content, offers a balanced boost of alertness and energy without jitters.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>Dark Chocolate</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Always a joy for the palate and the brain, dark chocolate has a high cacao content and is packed with flavanols. These compounds are recognized for enhancing blood flow to the brain, increasing cognitive function.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>Avocado</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Often dubbed 'green gold,' avocado is a rich source of healthy Omega 3 fats. Regular consumption supports overall brain health and cognitive functions. It's also packed with folate and vitamin K, both nutrients are pivotal for cognitive functions and preventing blood clots in the brain.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>Coconut Oil</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Containing medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), coconut oil has been highlighted for its potential role in cognitive awareness and function. It offers a quick energy source, which could be especially beneficial in conditions like Alzheimer's, where glucose metabolism is impaired.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>Walnuts and Flaxseed</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>These aren't just crunchy additions to your salads, cereal, and baked goods. These superfoods are rich in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a plant-based <a href=\"https://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/9-foods-can-change-brain/\">omega-3 fatty acid</a>, that offers a variety of neuroprotective benefits. Regularly including these in your diet can pave the way for enhanced cognitive functions and possibly deter the onset of neurodegenerative conditions.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2>The Symbiotic Relationship of Gut and Brain Health</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Modern science has illuminated the intricate connections between <a href=\"https://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/how-is-your-brain-connected-to-your-gut-7-facts-about-gut-health/\">our digestive system and brain</a>. The gut, often termed the \"second brain,\" is critical to many aspects of our health, including the mind. Our intestinal flora, a complex ecosystem of microorganisms, plays a crucial role in digesting food, producing vitamins, and warding off infections.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Recent revelations have highlighted a direct communication line between the gut and the brain. Imbalances in the gut microbiome can influence mood disorders and cognitive health issues throughout the body. Foods rich in probiotics, like yogurt and fermented foods like sauerkraut and kimchi, improve gut health and influence mood and cognitive function.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Beyond aiding digestion, fiber-rich foods like lentils, beans, and whole grains can modulate the gut flora. A balanced gut flora is vital for mental well-being, potentially influencing stress, anxiety, and even depressive symptoms. The mind-body connection is real, and it starts with understanding gut health and making better choices overall.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2>Better Brain Health on a Budget</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In today's health-conscious world, there's often a misconception that nourishing your brain has to come with a hefty price tag. However, with some savvy strategies and ingenuity, you can feed your brain its needs without breaking the bank.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>Seasonal and Local Shopping</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>One of the best ways to acquire affordable superfoods is to focus on those in-season. Not only are in-season foods fresher and richer in nutrients, and tastier, but are also more abundantly available, which drives prices down. Moreover, venturing into <a href=\"https://www.thepennyhoarder.com/save-money/how-to-save-at-farmers-markets/\" target=\"_blank\">local farmer's markets</a> can lead you to a goldmine of affordable selections—just know what you're looking for.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>The Power of Preservation</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Frozen sections in grocery stores are often overlooked when searching for superfoods. Yet, many frozen varieties, especially berries and green veggies, retain most nutrients and can be just as effective for brain health. They also come with the added advantage of longer shelf lives and often lower prices.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>Plant Based Home-Grown</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Growing superfoods can be fulfilling and cost-effective if you have a green thumb or even just some extra space. Herbs like rosemary, sage, and turmeric are known for their brain-boosting properties and can thrive in pots on a sunny windowsill. Similarly, veggies such as spinach and kale can be grown in backyard plots or containers.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>Staying Informed Buying with Bonuses</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The world of superfoods is ever-evolving. What might be a costly trend today might be replaced by a more affordable yet equally potent alternative tomorrow. Many organic food stores and specialized shops offer enticing incentives to make the switch more affordable.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>From significant discounts to loyalty programs, these establishments are making it easier than ever to nourish your brain. Some even offer <a href=\"https://www.creditdonkey.com/sign-up-bonuses.html\" target=\"_blank\">sign-up bonuses</a> for first-time buyers, providing a cost-effective way to jumpstart your journey into the world of brain-boosting superfoods.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Likewise, before you dive into the world of superfoods head-first, make sure you find affordable options that come as a byproduct of ethical farming, as there have been <a href=\"https://www.bupipedream.com/opinions/126816/the-avocado-industry-thrives-on-exploitation-of-mexico/\" target=\"_blank\">reports of exploitation related to avocados</a>, acai berries, and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>As we stand at the crossroads of ancient tradition and groundbreaking technologies, it's evident that our past still holds the key to our future. And in researching longevity and the desire for an active and healthy life, nutrition emerges as our ally.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>We broke down the benefits of the 5 most overlooked superfoods and how to introduce them into our diet seamlessly, as well as the juxtaposition between age-old wisdom and cutting-edge science by showcasing humanity's continuous journey towards holistic well-being.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Incorporating them into our diets is more than just a trend; it's a testament to the profound ways our dietary choices can shape the health and vitality of our minds. </p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><em>Nahla Davies is a software developer and tech writer.

Whether it’s a dog or a cat, pets offer unconditional love, the ability to lower stress, and the opportunity to build a community with other pet lovers. Pets support our mental health in dozens of ways, every single day. But how do we care for them in return? </p><p>In partnership with Nulo, we’re celebrating Pet Wellness Month this October by highlighting the small, meaningful ways pet parents fuel their fur babies’ happiness and health. We asked readers: “What’s one small thing you do that makes a big difference for your pet?” The best answers win a custom pet portrait, a wellness care package courtesy of Nulo, and a donation to their local pet shelter. </p><p>Of all the hilarious and heartfelt answers we got, three of them stood out. Here are the winning responses and three examples of how you, too, can make a huge difference for your pet in small, simple ways. </p><h3>Keeping their bodies strong</h3><br /><img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"57c29\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk3NjEzNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODQxMzI3MH0.b8s0mbksFwTDNnMR8VUJ5PcFiD0z2FtuySP5P3aAwKM/img.jpg?width=980\" /><p>Meet Tee: He’s a loyal, playful ball of energy that helps his owner, Jailon, by bringing joy and calm to his life every day. To show Tee love, Jailon prioritizes physical health and emotional wellness. For exercise, Jailon makes sure Tee has daily walks, playtime, and making sure his diet is balanced with high-quality, nutritious food (Nulo being one of his favorites). </p>\n<p>But emotional wellness is equally important. “One small thing I do that makes a big difference for my pet is setting aside dedicated connection time every day,” Jailon says. “No phones, no distractions, just us. The time helps us bond and keeps Tee’s mind active and healthy.”</p><h3>Communication is key</h3><br /><img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"6dbd8\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk3NjA2NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgwMTk4MjA0NH0.e0Bj3enfivWYQ1D7MK_Q2tmv9dW2uweqauE1SZeOdlc/img.jpg?width=980\" /><p>Mary Ann’s dog Aiden was rescued from her local Humane Society, and as a former stray, the beginning of their relationship wasn’t always easy. </p>\n<p>“Aiden was so scared that he would sleep in a corner or under a bed. My husband and I had to sleep with him on the floor until we gained his trust,” Mary Ann said. To soothe his separation anxiety, Mary Ann started talking to him regularly.</p>\n<p>“I started telling him, ‘mommy is going to work,’ or ‘mommy will be back’ and he started to understand,” she said. </p>\n<p>Amazingly, Aiden responded. Now, his anxiety has improved and their bond is stronger than ever. Aiden still relishes the gentle words of affirmation that Mary Ann continues to give him. </p><p>“His face is so expressive and his smile melts our hearts,” she said. “We get him to fall asleep by repeatedly telling him, ‘I love you, Aiden.’”</p><h3>Building them a place to call home</h3><br /><img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"3f7cf\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk4OTQ2NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5NDAwNDM2N30.nBfrxb3XdF0mbaFhxTm5y-iBXNfCLI2Xr7qY6q_F6Rg/img.jpg?width=980\" /><p>Our feline friends need love, too. That’s why Amber created a cozy habitat for her longhair tuxedo cat, Precious, on the nights where she likes to roam. Adopted from a local shelter eight years ago, Precious is now 16—and not fond of staying indoors. </p><p>“In her old age, Precious has become very anxious being inside,” Amber said. Even in the cold winter months, Precious prefers staying outside on their back deck or exploring their 10-acre property. “She usually refuses to come inside, even on cold nights,” Amber said. </p><p>After many failed attempts to get her inside for the evening, Amber and her family realized it would be unfair to keep her confined when she wasn’t comfortable. As a compromise, Amber’s handy husband built a safe haven for her outside. </p><p>“She couldn't just have a tiny little box. Our girl was too good for that,” Amber said. “Now we can rest easy at night knowing she is safe, warm, and secure in her own private bungalow.” </p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"96964\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk4OTQ1OC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3ODE1NTIyMn0.zE1xb1OZ45KohbCQocMJDQp7A-0V_8MSvTBYwPOBr6U/img.png?width=980\" /><p>Showing love for your pets—especially in the form of regular exercise, safe surroundings and good nutrition—is the best way to keep them happy and healthy for as long as possible. And when we help our pets live longer, we’re nurturing the connection that makes our lives richer, too.</p><p class=\"\"><br /><em><strong>Good nutrition is the cornerstone of a happy pet.

It's a living, breathing network of connections and shared experiences. While it's usually defined as “a group of people living in the same place or having a particular characteristic in common,” true community runs much deeper than that.\n</p><p><strong>Diversity</strong></p><p>\n\tIt doesn’t matter how different we are. What matters in building a community is the desire to live in a peaceful and caring environment, despite all our differences.Good Neighbors<br />\n</p><p><strong>Good Neighbors</strong><br /></p><p>\n\tWhen searching for a new place to call home, we hope to stumble upon neighbors who can transform a neighborhood into something meaningful. We all need to be surrounded by people who genuinely care for the well-being of others. Only this type of people can create a community that is more than just a bunch of individuals living next to each other.\n</p><p><strong>It Starts with One</strong><br /></p><p>\n\tBuilding a strong community starts with individual contributions, no matter how small. As long as you are kind and willing to help others in need, you’ll be a great community member.

The <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/this-school-replaced-detention-with-meditation-the-results-are-stunning-ex1\" target=\"_blank\">efficacy of detention</a> has long been debated among <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/teaching-explains-day-viral-video-ex1\" target=\"_blank\">educators</a> and administrators, but one high school in Maine has started providing an alternative to traditional detention that has people buzzing.</p><p>Morse High School in Bath, Maine, gives students who have broken a detention-worthy rule a choice: Spend 3 hours sitting around doing nothing in a classroom or join the <a href=\"https://www.good.is/the-four-most-underpaid-critical-jobs-in-us\" target=\"_blank\">school counselor</a> for a 3.5-mile hike. For some, that might sound more like a reward than a punishment, but there's an intention behind the hike option that makes some sense from a behavioral perspective. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">- YouTube</small>        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">                <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhfAj-W_jbY\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com</a>        </small>        </p><p>School counselor Leslie Trundy started the program in 2024 after attending an outdoor education conference. She includes some reading of nature poetry during the hike and routinely invites students to join the outdoor club she started at the school. Trundy <a href=\"https://www.mainepublic.org/education-news/2025-06-18/in-bath-students-choose-a-hike-over-detention\" target=\"_blank\">told Maine Public Radio</a> that she wondered whether spending time in nature might get kids to open up about problems they're dealing with in their lives. </p><p>\"My hope was that time in the woods like I could sort of take the skills that I have on the road with them or on the trail, and be a listener for them, and pay back the time to the school and sort of serve their consequence. But also receive more care and attention,\" said Trundy.</p><p>\"It's been so incredible for me personally, making connections with students I wouldn't normally get to talk with,\" <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhfAj-W_jbY\" target=\"_blank\">she told CBS 13.</a> \"Being a listener to them, finding out what's important to them, kind of what's going on in their lives.\"</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"hiking, teens, high school, detention, outdoors\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ee210\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk5MDE2OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgyMjY1MzY4Mn0.4ch6Kujw9oFa9w3vDMTS3RcSedRc3uhwvAqd1_20T0Q/img.jpg?width=980\" />        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Is hiking an appropriate alternative to detention?</small>        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos\" target=\"_blank\">Photo credit: Canva</a></small>        </p>                <p>Some have criticized the approach as not being an appropriate punishment and some parents have refused to allow their kids to choose the hiking option. But according to some of the students who have participated, the hike isn't exactly a walk in the park compared to just sitting around. </p><p>“Sometimes the hike feels really like a punishment for them, even though they've chosen it,” Trundy told <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/26/nx-s1-5437873/at-this-school-kids-given-detention-can-choose-a-hike-instead\" target=\"_blank\"><u>NPR</u></a>. “Like, they might've chosen it 'cause it was a lessening sentence, but it did feel like they were having to expend effort.”</p><p>Nicholas Tanguay, a student who was assigned detention for yelling at a teacher, concurred. But he also said the hiking offers an opportunity to reflect in a way that detention in a classroom doesn't. </p><p>\"It makes me have to, like, walk. It makes it makes you breathe heavily, obviously, and it feels like an accomplishment, almost,\" the student said. \"I think that maybe it's also good for people's mental health. I mean, in general, nature and hikes are just really good for people's mentality. So...maybe you've had a bad day, the option to do this after knowing you have a detention means you have to dread it less.\"</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"hiking, teens, high school, detention, outdoors\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ba8f7\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk5MDE3Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODY1NzY3MH0.ApYT1Se1fMxgJTeKq4tmUzXfLDlsTd8m1RVQj6cFV70/img.jpg?width=980\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Time in nature is good for everyone.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos\" target=\"_blank\">Photo credit: Canva</a></small></p><p>Dreading detention less may not seem like the desired outcome—dreading detention is kind of the whole point of detention—but the question we need to ask is whether hiking is a more effective way of altering student behavior than traditional punishment. </p><p>Kids misbehave for many reasons, some of which may better be addressed with time outdoors, physical exercise, mentoring by a caring adult, and a sense of community than by sitting for three hours doing nothing. In fact, some of the students who have done the hiking detention have since joined Trundy's outdoor club, going on hikes that aren't required and gaining the benefits of them of their own accord. </p><p>Time will tell how effective the program is as Trundy gathers data, but in the meantime, people have opinions. Some feel that alternative programs like this weaken the consequences for bad behavior, making students less likely to comply with rules. Others see a lot of value in the approach, giving kids who act out a healthy place to process, which may lead to better behavior over time. </p><p>But what most people seem to agree on, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SamBentley/posts/pfbid02E6zdMzP5qQiYfxtHPpTaXwU7T6Q2hMzG7Au2nFG1p64o8CfEF7gBjiHwsUgkBSZPl\" target=\"_blank\">based on comments about this program</a>, is that young people need more time outdoors in general:</p><p>\"I think the real answer is that kids of all ages need recess/outdoor time. A lot of my middle schoolers aren’t awful; they just have energy to burn and would benefit from running around for fifteen minutes every day.\"</p><p>\"Maybe nature hikes and outdoor brain breaks could be offered as part of the school day for all students. I bet we’d see fewer kids in detention. The microbiome of trees and plants works with our own biology to reduce anxiety, depression. Time outdoors has shown to help reduce ADHD symptoms and improve focus. When we take recess away or don’t offer outdoor time, we exacerbate problems.\"</p><p>\"Being out in nature improves executive function, improves mood, enhances memory and self control.I think improving connection with self, nature and others is what's going to improve so much for kids who are struggling in school environments.\"</p><p>\"Maybe add dogs to walk from a local shelter for even more positive results.\" (Now there's an idea.)</p><p>Considering how many students get detention multiple times, trying an alternative to help them regulate themselves and make better choices probably isn't a bad idea. Here's to educators trying innovative approaches to help students reach their fullest potential. </p>",

Some experts believe that stress and depression can happen as we get old. Here are some of the main causes that can lead to stress and depression:</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stressful events – We go through many stressful events, such as work-related pressure, personal problems, and relationship breakdown. All of these events can trigger stress which can lead to depression.

These are both psychological conditions which may not present right away. There aren’t some tests that you can perform to figure out exactly how much stress someone is in. Having said that, let's try and understand some of the symptoms of depression and stress.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Decrease energy and insomnia - Prolonged stress can cause chronic fatigue and disruptions in sleep, which may result in a lack of energy. Sleep depression can lead to a condition called insomnia. A lack of sleep can disturb mental health.

If you find yourself losing interest in things you love, this could be a sign of increased stress and depression.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anxiety – A classic sign of stress and depression is anxiety. Feeling anxious can increase heart rate, heavy sweating and rapid breathing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Digestive issues – Stress has been found to be associated with causing digestive issues. This could lead to constipation, heartburn, diarrhea, as well as digestive disorders.

Regular exercise helps to have a positive impact on moods. There are multiple physical activities that can help you to manage stress and depression. Activities like yoga, stretching, morning run, or sports are helpful in staying active.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Fitness helps to stay healthy. Staying healthy helps to reduce stress. Less stress leads to not having depression. Whether you can spend 20 min or one hour, make exercise a routine. You will observe the positive benefits of exercise in managing stress and depression.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Healthy Diet&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>When asked what is the best habit to develop in order to manage stress and depression, many experts recommend a healthy diet. Eating healthy can have multiple health benefits, such as controlling blood sugar levels, managing hormones, boosting immunity, and nourishment. Eating junk or unhealthy food can have an adverse effect on health which can lead to stress.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Making a habit of eating healthy food is good for avoiding stress and depression. You can also include health supplements to bridge the nutrition gap. Including lots of vegetables and fruits is ideal for getting all the essential nutrients that the body needs. You can even prepare a diet plan which can make it easier to form a habit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Meditation&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Doing meditation early in the morning has proven to be helpful in reducing stress and depression. Even 15 min of meditation can have a significant benefit on your stress levels. Meditation helps you channel your energy throughout the day to stay focused and motivated.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The most popular way to meditate is to close your eyes and focus on your breaths. This helps to control blood pressure, thus reducing stress.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hydration&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Staying hydrated is an excellent habit to avoid stress. Dehydration can affect cognitive function negatively. Dehydration also causes fatigue, symptoms of low mood, irritability and confusion. Make a habit of drinking water early in the morning, as you are a little dehydrated when you wake up.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>While hydration alone cannot help to cure the signs of depression and anxiety, it will certainly help to manage your energy levels which will keep you upbeat throughout the day.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Limit the use of technology</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>It is hard to imagine our life without the latest technology and devices. We are so dependent on technology that we use it for almost every daily function. This brings its challenges. Many experts have linked the use of a smartphone to an increase in stress and anxiety that lead to depression.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Although it seems difficult, limiting the use of technology is vital to avoid stress and depression. Reducing the time on social media platforms can have positive benefits on your mental health. Make it a habit to spend only limited time on these platforms. Allot a certain number of hours to the use of technology daily and stick to it. You will see the stress levels go down dramatically.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Every good change happens through good habits. Stress and depression are serious issues affecting people, so developing good habits and routines can help long and stress-free.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/5-simple-habits-and-routines-to-keep-you-away-from-depression-and-stress-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">5 Simple Habits and Routines to Keep You Away from Depression and Stress</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.pickthebrain.com/blog\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pick the Brain | Motivation and Self Improvement</a>.</p>",

I don’t even know, and I’m always online.\"</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"Halloween, candy, costumes, senior living, kids, trick or treat\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"cc9b7\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk3NjQwMi9vcmlnaW4uZ2lmIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2OTAxNzc2N30.QAfqAy0OVSBa41t7b8QB9HwMe49yDSKrnWhbQqW596c/img.gif?width=980\" />        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Trick Or Treater gets a lot of candy</small>        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">            <a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/PersonaJourney-trick-or-treat-halloween-candy-overload-akUm1JSzqPKIXUr2Px\" target=\"_blank\">Giphy</a> GIF by Persona</small>        </p><p> And then there's the logistics of candy. I called my mom, who is in a senior living home, and asked if her facility did this. Her answer was surprising: \"I hope not. Where would I even get candy?\"</p><p>But the idea is still a lovely one, at least for some. And if it's something that resonates, here are a few tips for making it work.</p>  <h2>NOTE THE SENIOR FACILITY</h2><p>There's a big difference between senior independent living, assisted living, and memory care. It's important to note that before attempting a visit which includes children. Senior independent would probably be the best place to start, as the residents (often) have fewer physical or memory-health issues.</p>  <h2>CALL AHEAD</h2><p>This might take some time, but call around to different facilities to make sure this is allowed. Usually, this is a planned event on their part, so while they may love the idea, it certainly takes coordination. The site, <a href=\"https://www.aplaceformom.com/lp?&amp;kw=3234-APFM:NB:USA:GOOGLE:Misc:Exact&amp;kwg=&amp;keyword=living%20centers%20near%20me&amp;match=e&amp;device=c&amp;network=g&amp;hcinquiry=&amp;account=Google:APFM:HMI&amp;campaignid=21291296783&amp;adgroupid=161053958783&amp;ad_id=699465812850&amp;geo=9030971&amp;targetID=kwd-379238823828&amp;hl=&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=paid_media_sem&amp;utm_campaign=APFM:NB:USA:GOOGLE:Misc:Exact&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=living%20centers%20near%20me&amp;attribution_id=155&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21291296783&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADkMj5LraGz6BJrudl9WlbYgrYftu&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw9obIBhCAARIsAGHm1mQuwP40BAee7ghBOdgtWQy7UlChEBQK8cF2g9gf29ZEQxSO49AOkgUaAi2AEALw_wcB\" target=\"_blank\">A Place for Mom </a>can offer a list of nearby residences.</p><h2>OFFER A DONATION </h2><p>Getting out and getting candy (or having the funds to do so) should also be a consideration for something like this. One idea is that once you've established that a facility is hosting an event like this (and/or is open to it), consider offering money to buy the actual candy. Or one could drop the candy off. </p>",

The <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/this-school-replaced-detention-with-meditation-the-results-are-stunning-ex1\" target=\"_blank\">efficacy of detention</a> has long been debated among <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/teaching-explains-day-viral-video-ex1\" target=\"_blank\">educators</a> and administrators, but one high school in Maine has started providing an alternative to traditional detention that has people buzzing.</p><p>Morse High School in Bath, Maine, gives students who have broken a detention-worthy rule a choice: Spend 3 hours sitting around doing nothing in a classroom or join the <a href=\"https://www.good.is/the-four-most-underpaid-critical-jobs-in-us\" target=\"_blank\">school counselor</a> for a 3.5-mile hike. For some, that might sound more like a reward than a punishment, but there's an intention behind the hike option that makes some sense from a behavioral perspective. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">- YouTube</small>        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">                <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhfAj-W_jbY\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com</a>        </small>        </p><p>School counselor Leslie Trundy started the program in 2024 after attending an outdoor education conference. She includes some reading of nature poetry during the hike and routinely invites students to join the outdoor club she started at the school. Trundy <a href=\"https://www.mainepublic.org/education-news/2025-06-18/in-bath-students-choose-a-hike-over-detention\" target=\"_blank\">told Maine Public Radio</a> that she wondered whether spending time in nature might get kids to open up about problems they're dealing with in their lives. </p><p>\"My hope was that time in the woods like I could sort of take the skills that I have on the road with them or on the trail, and be a listener for them, and pay back the time to the school and sort of serve their consequence. But also receive more care and attention,\" said Trundy.</p><p>\"It's been so incredible for me personally, making connections with students I wouldn't normally get to talk with,\" <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhfAj-W_jbY\" target=\"_blank\">she told CBS 13.</a> \"Being a listener to them, finding out what's important to them, kind of what's going on in their lives.\"</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"hiking, teens, high school, detention, outdoors\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ee210\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk5MDE2OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgyMjY1MzY4Mn0.4ch6Kujw9oFa9w3vDMTS3RcSedRc3uhwvAqd1_20T0Q/img.jpg?width=980\" />        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Is hiking an appropriate alternative to detention?</small>        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos\" target=\"_blank\">Photo credit: Canva</a></small>        </p>                <p>Some have criticized the approach as not being an appropriate punishment and some parents have refused to allow their kids to choose the hiking option. But according to some of the students who have participated, the hike isn't exactly a walk in the park compared to just sitting around. </p><p>“Sometimes the hike feels really like a punishment for them, even though they've chosen it,” Trundy told <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/26/nx-s1-5437873/at-this-school-kids-given-detention-can-choose-a-hike-instead\" target=\"_blank\"><u>NPR</u></a>. “Like, they might've chosen it 'cause it was a lessening sentence, but it did feel like they were having to expend effort.”</p><p>Nicholas Tanguay, a student who was assigned detention for yelling at a teacher, concurred. But he also said the hiking offers an opportunity to reflect in a way that detention in a classroom doesn't. </p><p>\"It makes me have to, like, walk. It makes it makes you breathe heavily, obviously, and it feels like an accomplishment, almost,\" the student said. \"I think that maybe it's also good for people's mental health. I mean, in general, nature and hikes are just really good for people's mentality. So...maybe you've had a bad day, the option to do this after knowing you have a detention means you have to dread it less.\"</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"hiking, teens, high school, detention, outdoors\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ba8f7\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk5MDE3Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODY1NzY3MH0.ApYT1Se1fMxgJTeKq4tmUzXfLDlsTd8m1RVQj6cFV70/img.jpg?width=980\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Time in nature is good for everyone.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos\" target=\"_blank\">Photo credit: Canva</a></small></p><p>Dreading detention less may not seem like the desired outcome—dreading detention is kind of the whole point of detention—but the question we need to ask is whether hiking is a more effective way of altering student behavior than traditional punishment. </p><p>Kids misbehave for many reasons, some of which may better be addressed with time outdoors, physical exercise, mentoring by a caring adult, and a sense of community than by sitting for three hours doing nothing. In fact, some of the students who have done the hiking detention have since joined Trundy's outdoor club, going on hikes that aren't required and gaining the benefits of them of their own accord. </p><p>Time will tell how effective the program is as Trundy gathers data, but in the meantime, people have opinions. Some feel that alternative programs like this weaken the consequences for bad behavior, making students less likely to comply with rules. Others see a lot of value in the approach, giving kids who act out a healthy place to process, which may lead to better behavior over time. </p><p>But what most people seem to agree on, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SamBentley/posts/pfbid02E6zdMzP5qQiYfxtHPpTaXwU7T6Q2hMzG7Au2nFG1p64o8CfEF7gBjiHwsUgkBSZPl\" target=\"_blank\">based on comments about this program</a>, is that young people need more time outdoors in general:</p><p>\"I think the real answer is that kids of all ages need recess/outdoor time. A lot of my middle schoolers aren’t awful; they just have energy to burn and would benefit from running around for fifteen minutes every day.\"</p><p>\"Maybe nature hikes and outdoor brain breaks could be offered as part of the school day for all students. I bet we’d see fewer kids in detention. The microbiome of trees and plants works with our own biology to reduce anxiety, depression. Time outdoors has shown to help reduce ADHD symptoms and improve focus. When we take recess away or don’t offer outdoor time, we exacerbate problems.\"</p><p>\"Being out in nature improves executive function, improves mood, enhances memory and self control.I think improving connection with self, nature and others is what's going to improve so much for kids who are struggling in school environments.\"</p><p>\"Maybe add dogs to walk from a local shelter for even more positive results.\" (Now there's an idea.)</p><p>Considering how many students get detention multiple times, trying an alternative to help them regulate themselves and make better choices probably isn't a bad idea. Here's to educators trying innovative approaches to help students reach their fullest potential. </p>",

The show was enormously popular and put Chappelle on the map. <em>Chappelle’s Show</em> was scheduled to have a third season after the success of the first two seasons but that never happened. </p><h4>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/why-dave-chappelle-walked-away-from-50-million-dollars/\">Why Dave Chappelle Walked Away From $50 Million Dollars …</a></h4><p>Instead, Chappelle famously walked away from the series and a $50 million paycheck. He abruptly left during production in 2006, effectively breaking his contract with Comedy Central. He was reportedly unhappy with the direction the show had taken and needed to step away.</p><p>But there has been one person who has been with the comedian through it all and that's his wife, Elaine.</p><h2>Dave and Elaine Chappelle Prioritize Family Over Money</h2><p>In an interview with <em><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20050516081506/https:/www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1061415,00.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Time</a></em>, Chappelle spoke about moving to Ohio and walking away from his show, saying, \"Coming here, I don't have the distractions of fame. It quiets the ego down. I'm interested in the kind of person I've got to become. I want to be well-rounded, and the industry is a place of extremes. I want to be well-balanced.

Others thought it was a mental health issue that led comedian Dave Chappelle to walk away from it all. That wasn’t the case at all. Chappelle simply reprioritized his life in a way that was better for himself and his family.</p><p>Through the media circus that followed Dave Chappelle’s wife Elaine Mendoza stood by him.

Dave and Elaine Chappelle met more than 20 years ago, so she would have been in her 20s.

Up until this point Dave Chappelle had been a regular guest on Stern’s show and even credited the exposure Stern gave him with helping his career. After they made those so-called jokes about the future Elaine Chappelle, he has continually refused to ever appear on Stern’s show again.

No iPads</h3><p><em>“All I’m going to say is my kid has a whole world to explore and none of that has to do with being stuck in front of a tablet.”</em></p><h3>2. No smartphone until high school</h3><p><em>“Kids that are younger than that age do not know internet safety to a point where I feel comfortable letting them have free reign of the internet.”</em></p>   <h3>3. Teaching the value of education</h3><p><em>“What I’m going to teach them is [education] has nothing to do with how much money you’re making or how successful you’ll be professionally. But you will still value it, nonetheless. You will go with it as far as you possibly can, and then once you’re done with it, you can do whatever you want.”</em></p><h3>4. Respect your teachers and treat them well</h3><p><em>“This may be biased because I am a teacher, but everyone who has gone through a professional degree program and has put in the time and is there, giving you the quality education, deserves some type of attention and deserves to be treated well.”</em></p><p><em><br /></em></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e3a87\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk4OTUyOC9vcmlnaW4uZ2lmIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5MDk1ODY4NH0.WpMNyaTRUsnXhcLHgfLWhAxP-msKTezPLu0uFMKgdsk/img.gif?width=980\" />                <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">                <a href=\"https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExZzZoNDN6aWswamthMnNnbWY3cWowdnNncnJkanMwcGN2ZzFqNXdoaSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/lQPHNPMPZ7tcIwseGn/giphy.gif\" target=\"_blank\">media3.giphy.com</a>        </small>        </p><h3>5. Be kind to elderly folks</h3><p><em>“If they’re on public transportation and they’re sitting down and there’s an old lady standing next to them and there are no other seats available, my child will know to stand up and give that lady his seat.”</em></p><h3>6. Yes, ma’am</h3><p><em>“It does not matter your age or status in society, as long as they are respecting their pronouns, that’s how we’re gonna be talking to other people.”</em></p><h3>7. Greetings and gratitude</h3><p><em>“Simple greetings and simple terms of gratitude are just not being taught like they used to. I think it’s really sad.”</em></p><h3>8. Consequences for poor behavior</h3><p><em>“If they’re neglecting their schoolwork and not doing what they’re supposed to do, they get their technology taken away. … Simple things like this are pretty common sense and I’m not sure why they’re not being done anymore.”</em></p><h3>9. Respect adult conversations and spaces</h3><p><em>“They don’t get to interrupt 2 adults speaking to each other. They don’t get to come and butt in at an inappropriate time when 2 people are talking to each other.\"</em></p><h3>10. Clean your mess</h3><p><em>“My child is going to put as much work in the house as we are regardless of whether he’s paying rent out of his own pocket or not. That’s because when my son becomes an adult, I want him to be a partner or a spouse or a roommate that someone is proud to have around.”</em></p><p><em><br /></em></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f2bdc\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk4OTUxOC9vcmlnaW4uZ2lmIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NTc0Mjk5NH0.ucQ0_c390MdXUGPuXZKMBE4mJ7lq5Nov_aipgTETXiY/img.gif?width=980\" />                <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">                <a href=\"https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExOW9hcGF4aDNjdGZ0Z204dnhqc253eHU4Ynp1NXFnODdtbnIwZGs0YyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/HIrYP4RI9DpLy/giphy.gif\" target=\"_blank\">media3.giphy.com</a>        </small>        </p><h3>11.

Getting out of plans</h2><p><em>\"Being able to get out of any plans. Literally anything.\"</em></p><p><i>“'Ooh, sorry, my daughter naps at that time.' Narrator: her daughter hadn’t taken a nap in 3 years.\"</i></p><p><em>\"They are also a great excuse to leave early. My little girl (bless her heart) starts saying “I want to go home” without fail about 1 hr into visits with my in-laws. She is the perfect child.\"</em></p><h2>2. You can be a kid again</h2><p><em>\"One benefit I noticed is being able to act like a kid again without people judging. You can dance & be silly with your kids in public & people just think you're an amazing parent for being so fun. But what people don't know is the person can naturally be that silly & fun-loving without being with the kids.\"</em></p><p><em>\"Went to a wedding recently, and I danced with my 7yo for like 2 hours. We had a blast!\"</em></p><h2>3. Affection on demand</h2><p><em>\"Hugs and kisses almost any time you need one.\"</em></p><p><em>\"My almost 5-year-old loves the love attacks. He'll be doing something only to get peppered with kisses all over his head. 'Silly mommy. I love you,' is what I get.\"</em></p><p><em><br /></em></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"son, daughter, hugs, happy mom, mom and daughter, mom and son\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"36297\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTQxNzUwNi9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NjM3MTYwNH0._i1Ex-JkXO5aBrHENL9SfoQGa4wLdOkrDntxwMUGU5k/img.png?width=980\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A son and daughter huigging their mom. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">via <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Canva/Photos</a></small></p><h2>4. You're 'tired'</h2><p><em>\"You’re allowed to be a little antisocial without it being rude because everyone assumes you’re tired.\"</em></p><h2>5. Baby wipes</h2><p><em>\"Always having a baby wipe in my bag when I spill my own food or drink.\"</em></p><p><em>\"I'm still carrying wipes even my child is 10. If she is not with me. I still have wipes with me.\"</em></p><h2>6. Social opportunities</h2><p><em>\"For me, as a fairly social person, just her giving me opportunities to interact with other people when I'm out and about more than I otherwise would. My daughter is only 1, so she only has a few words that she says, but she says 'hi' very clearly, with a wave, and will say hi and wave to literally anyone and everyone, and virtually everyone responds very positively. And there's always just kind of an instant rapport with other parents that you meet in your day-to-day, where it's like, I have no idea if we have anything else in common, but this one important thing is something we share. So even when the kids aren't there, say in my running group, for example, all the moms kind of have this unspoken bond that we wouldn't otherwise have.\"</em></p><h2>7. They improve your organizing skills</h2><p><em>\"If you're not the most organized person, having to provide structure to another person's life will more or less force you into place, or at least that is my experience. I know where I need to be before 9 AM and before 5 PM, and everything I must do alone on a weekday best be done during those times, and to Tetris my schedule goes lol.\"</em></p><p><em>\"This is exactly what I'm talking about. Never thought such a good thing would be a consequence of one of the wildest times of your life, parenthood. It's crazy.\"</em></p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/mtvcribs-organization-kathy-griffin-organized-1oJRRiSteRVLHf7JKH\"></a></p></div><p><br /></p><h2>8. Cup holders</h2><p><em>\"Always having cupholders everywhere you go if you're using a stroller.\"</em></p><p><em>\"Whenever we go back to Disneyland, I miss having a stroller so much. Disneyland with a stroller was such a great way to enjoy the park...places for our drinks, bag clips so I didn't have to lug a bag on my shoulders, the kids could cruise around and just nod off if they got tired without having to complain that their feet/legs were tired from all the walking. So many great benefits.\"</em></p><h2>9. Video games</h2><p><em>\"I have a (moderately controlling) go-to video game buddy!\"</em></p><p><em>\"I got to introduce them to my favorite games and play along with them. There’s a lot of really good kid games we’ve played that I wouldn’t have gotten to play otherwise.\"</em></p><h2>10. Free fruit</h2><p><em>\"Free fruit in the grocery store. In my country, they leave out bins of free fruit for children. No limit on how much you can take. I always grab a small bag's worth of apples, pears, or oranges for my son. Saves money and he gets fresh fruit.\"</em></p><p><em><br /></em></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"boy and girl, supermarket, fruit, cherries, limes, grapes\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"1fd91\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTQxNzUxMi9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NjE1MTAyMn0.ryMGYSGj6V5nhI4R3buz_wW_dLECtR2LwOzNtjrb4iA/img.png?width=980\" />                        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Children grabbing fruit at the market.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">via <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/photos/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Canva/Photos</a></small></p><h2>11. Airport line</h2><p><em>\"Faster line at a lot of airports, especially if you travel internationally/outside US.\"</em></p><p><em>\"Just experienced this flying into Nice, France. Dreadfully hot day, long line and then! Children’s line. So lovely.\"</em></p><h2>12. Ending negative cycles</h2><p><em>\"Drawing the line with toxic people got so much easier.\"</em></p><p><em>\"I’ve been chasing my dad for 30+ years, trying to get his attention. Had my baby, and he showed up for the first 3ish months, then squeaky tank noises. Hell, if that didn’t infuriate me. I couldn’t do it for myself, but I’ll be fcking had if I let my baby grow up wondering why “papaw” doesn’t come around for him. I’m so sorry bub, your grandpa (my FIL, not my dad) passed away. I wish you could’ve known him, he would have loved you so much.\"</em></p><h2>13. A sense of purpose</h2><p><em>\"Having a deep feeling of purpose in life. I don’t know if other people expect to get this feeling, but I didn’t. It makes me have a much easier time finding meaning in doing chores and going to work and trying to keep myself healthy.\"</em></p><p><em>\"I second this. I have lived a pretty wild life tramping around the world. Nothing, and I mean nothing, in the thousands of experiences I have had compare to the meaning I get from being a dad.\"</em></p><h2>14. Joy of Christmas</h2><p><em>\"Christmas being Christmas again. The joy and traditions all come back full force.\"</em></p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/filmeditor-christmas-movies-a-story-3otPor91nTSiGXnX3y\"></a></p></div><p><br /></p><h2>15. Free labor</h2><p><em>\"I was not expecting how strong my son would become after entering puberty. Last summer, he helped carry so many of our moving boxes. The whole process was a lot less stressful just on the sheer labor he contributed.\"</em></p><h2>16. Brain development</h2><p><em>\"I felt like I had a lot of new brain pathways after our kids were born. And I find there's a lot I can learn from them.\"</em></p><p><em>\"So true!\"</em></p><h2>17. The joy they bring others</h2><p><em>\"Though my kid drives me CRAZY. Seeing the joy he brings to other people. His smile just lights up everyone's face. Its such a gift that I forget when he's on his 10th meltdown for the day.\"</em><br /></p>",

Because kids born between 1970 and 1985 had a very specific experience, some born in this era have taken to calling themselves Generation Goonie, after the 1985 film, <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/tag/goonies\" target=\"_self\">“The Goonies” </a>starring Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Key Huy Quan, and Corey Feldman.</p><p>\"The Goonies\" was a children's movie based on a story by Steven Spielberg, with a screenplay by Chris Columbus (who would go on to direct \"Home Alone\"), that was directed by Richard Donner (\"Superman: The Movie,\" \"Lethal Weapon,\" \"Scrooged\").</p><p>\"Having been fortunate enough to speak to a lot of audiences, I have found that younger generations consider Gen X lucky to have grown up without social media and cellphones,” Chris Clews, a keynote speaker and author of 'The Ultimate Essential Work & Life Lessons from '80s Pop Culture,' <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/gen-x-millennials-might-generation-goonie-2051372\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">told Newsweek.</a> “They often come up to me and express a desire to have grown up in an era where we knew where everyone was based on the bikes in a front yard, rather than location sharing on Snapchat.\"</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/goonies-9dlKFxYR00zDy\"></a></p></div><p><br /></p><p>“The Goonies” is a great example of the kids from this era because they lived a feral existence, traveling long distances on their bikes, had a thirst for adventure, a crude sense of humor, and an independent spirit that meant “never say die.” When their parents were on the verge of losing their houses, they didn’t wait for them to do something; they went on a dangerous mission to find pirates’ treasure to prevent them from being destroyed by evil developers. The Goonies' antics serve as a sharp contrast with today's kids, who seem to be wrapped in bubble wrap and closely monitored by their parents. It also shows the fun that kids can have when they spend their time outdoors, instead of on screens. </p><p>The Generation Goonie trend is taking off on TikTok, where many younger Gen Xers and older millennials proudly embrace the title.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>                <blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@its_me____stefanie/video/7455865482210643246\" class=\"tiktok-embed\">\n        <section>\n            <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@its_me____stefanie\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@its_me____stefanie\">@its_me____stefanie</a>\n            <p>💯 #genx #millennial #80sbaby #70sbaby #80smovies #80smusic</p>\n        </section>\n    </blockquote>\n                            <p><br /></p><p><br /></p>                <blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@amandasessions84/video/7483224696687758622\" class=\"tiktok-embed\">\n        <section>\n            <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@amandasessions84\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@amandasessions84\">@amandasessions84</a>\n            <p>#thegooniesera #thegooniesgeneration #foryoupage #fyp #goodenough #goodenoughcyndilauper #thegoonies #gooniesneversaydie☠️ #gooniesneverdie  #1984 #borninthe80s #90skid</p>\n        </section>\n    </blockquote>\n                            <p><br /></p><p><br /></p>                <blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@thatguynamedrob/video/7485018407369198879\" class=\"tiktok-embed\">\n        <section>\n            <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@thatguynamedrob\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@thatguynamedrob\">@thatguynamedrob</a>\n            <p></p>\n        </section>\n    </blockquote>\n                            <p><br /></p><p><br /></p>                <blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@michellemm50/video/7483590535090031918\" class=\"tiktok-embed\">\n        <section>\n            <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@michellemm50\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@michellemm50\">@michellemm50</a>\n            <p>Ok I’m here for this #fyp #foryou #over40 #vibes #zennial #millennial #genx #gooniesmovie</p>\n        </section>\n    </blockquote>\n                            <p><br /></p><p>\"1981, we had the best childhood out of any generation ever,\" Bugface wrote.</p><p>\"Now this is something I’m proud to be a part of!!!!!\" Rob wrote.</p><p>\"Hey you guys..\" 77 genx here, Yorkshire, England.

Humanity has crossed the digital divide and taken some of the adventure out of childhood. “The Goonies” is an excellent example of what we’ve lost, and those who understand the spirit of that era should be proud to embrace the title of “Goonie.”</p><p><em>This article originally appeared in March</em></p><p><br /></p>",

His father was a general manager in a company. He left for India after doctors declared Sidhaye to be mute and deaf.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once here, the children were enrolled in schools and encouraged to play sports of their choice. Being a disabled at a time when disability was considered to be a burden, was not easy for him. He was often discriminated against so he completely poured himself into various sporting activities like cricket, kho kho and wrestling.</span></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Baba Sidhaye trophies \" class=\"size-full wp-image-262499\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/post_attachments/uploads/2021/09/cricket.jpg\" width=\"1200\" /><br />\n<figcaption><em>Trophies of Baba Sidhaye</em></figcaption>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;He was a gifted player with a sixth sense.

That was the beginning of what would be an illustrious career,&rdquo; says Pravin.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After his first Ranji match in 1949, there was no stopping him.

It was considered a huge deal back in the day.

For the first half, they climbed into the top three, energised by rhythm, pace, and witty teamwork. But by the second half, certain assumptions unravelled.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&ldquo;We targeted parking lots, convinced they would be full of points, especially from <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/404094/code-effort-recycling-cigarette-butts-into-sustainable-products-plush-toys-creating-jobs/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cigarette butts</a>, which carry the highest value in the game. But many turned out to be privately owned and off-limits,&rdquo; he explains.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&ldquo;That miscalculation cost us both time and access to high-scoring litter. That is how we slipped to sixth place.&rdquo; They nonetheless diverted 71 kg of litter in the finals.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Back home, Amrit Arora relives that moment: &ldquo;When </span><span>Chennai Super Klean&rsquo;s</span><span> name was called on the stage, I felt a surge of pride and belonging. That moment meant the world to us &mdash; a recognition of all our hard work and passion. Though our strategy did not unfold perfectly and we narrowly missed the podium, it only strengthened our resolve to come back stronger and aim even higher next time.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>The team speaks</span></h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Amrit, a key member of the original team, was sidelined in 2025 due to injury. Madhusudhanan, the intern who had joined them in 2023, has since shifted focus to other environmental projects. This left the leader to rebuild and strengthen the team for upcoming challenges.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>To fill the gaps, he brought in new energy and expertise. Abishek Kezhakae Veetil, a disciplined powerlifter and Brazilian jiu-jitsu enthusiast, joined the team for 2025, bringing strength and agility for the demanding pace of Spogomi competitions.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"On one Sunday in July 2023, Chennai Super Klean cleared 400 kg of trash and qualified for the final stage\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/09/10/spogomi-world-cup-india-team-2025-09-10-19-26-25.jpg\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>On one Sunday in July 2023, Chennai Super Klean cleared 400 kg of trash and qualified for the final stage</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&ldquo;Spogomi is rare because it lets you combine competition with making a real difference. My background in powerlifting, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and high-intensity interval training gives me the speed, strength, and precision needed to perform at my best when every second counts,&rdquo; says Abishek.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Manivannan T, a Kovalam surfer and lifeguard, another new member, adds: &ldquo;Surfing taught me to respect the ocean. Over time, <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/490015/samvit-govindani-shaurya-sharma-project-reflex-upcycling-discarded-pvc-banners-empowering-women/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">picking up plastic waste</a> before heading into the water became second nature, almost a personal ritual. Spogomi takes that instinct and gives it a powerful framework. It turns an individual habit into a team effort, backed by strategy, structure, and shared purpose. For me, it feels like a natural evolution &mdash; changing care for the environment into something active, collective, and impactful.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>And Nikhil Ravikumar, Chief Organiser of India&rsquo;s qualifiers and a key figure behind the Nippon Foundation Spogomi World Cup India Stage, sees a broader meaning: &ldquo;The sport changes the very idea of cleaning. It is no longer seen as a chore or punishment &mdash; it becomes something to celebrate. It brings people together around a common purpose, turning civic responsibility into a joyful, energetic, and even competitive experience. What we are seeing with India&rsquo;s team is an example of that shift. They embody this spirit, full of passion, openness, and a clear sense of leadership. They are showing the country, and the world, what environmental action can look like when it is driven by community and pride.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Crafting a sharper team: Chennai Super Klean 2025</span></h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>By 2025, Spogomi was no longer niche. The India stage took place on 28 April at Marina Beach, with qualifiers also held at Bengaluru&rsquo;s Kempambudhi Lake. Sharun led a refined </span><span>Chennai Super Klean</span><span> line-up. As captain and strategist, he drew in Abishek for athletic precision and Manivannan for environmental instinct.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Together, they collected 251 kg of trash at the India qualifiers, securing victory and earning a place at the Spogomi World Cup in Tokyo once again. The sport demands more than strength &mdash; it requires mental acuity, agility, and spatial awareness.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"In Spogomi, teams of three get 1 hour to collect litter and 20 minutes to sort it\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/09/10/spogomi-world-cup-india-team-2025-09-10-19-29-29.jpg\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>In Spogomi, teams of three get 1 hour to collect litter and 20 minutes to sort it</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The team leader orchestrated the game plan, studying layouts, pedestrian patterns, and likely waste zones.

Or feel the rush of adrenaline as you engage in a high-speed<a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/86751/fighting-on-ice-hockey-india/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> ice hockey </a>match in the rugged beauty of Ladakh.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With their harsh winters, places like Kashmir and Ladakh transform into breathtaking winter wonderlands. These regions offer a unique canvas for sports that thrive in freezing temperatures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s dive into the rich history and thrilling future of some Indian winter sports, and experience the magic of these icy playgrounds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-ice-skating\">1. Ice skating</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The history of ice skating in Kashmir dates back to the colonial era when British officials, yearning for familiar sports from home, introduced skating to the region. During the biting cold months, when lakes like Dal freeze, the conditions become ideal for ice skating.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whether on the natural ice of Pahalgam&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/302828/best-must-take-winter-treks-in-himalayas-uttarakhand-views-adventure/\">frozen rivers</a>, or the meticulously maintained rinks of Gulmarg, the sport has found a fervent following. The best time to experience ice skating in Kashmir is from December to March when the chill in the air creates the perfect conditions for thick, stable ice.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-ice-skiing\">2. Ice skiing</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Gulmarg is renowned as one of India&rsquo;s premier skiing destinations. The origins of skiing in Gulmarg trace back to 1927, when it was established by British Army officers, Major Metcarp and Major Hadow, who founded the Ski Club of India.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During the pre-independence era, skiing in Gulmarg gained considerable popularity, with the area hosting significant skiing events during Christmas and Easter. The skiing season in Gulmarg generally begins before Christmas and continues until mid-April.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img alt=\"India provides a memorable winter sports experience set against the breathtaking backdrop of snow capped Kashmir, Ladakh and more. \" class=\"wp-image-393984\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/post_attachments/uploads/2024/12/winter-sports-india-1-1735628370.jpg\" style=\"width: 840px; height: auto;\" /><br />\n<figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">India provides a memorable winter sports experience set against the breathtaking backdrop of snow-capped Kashmir, Ladakh, and more.

Sledging</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another popular sport to try out in Gulmarg is sledging. Kongdori, particularly, is a popular destination for snow sledging, where locally handcrafted sledges enhance the experience.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other places where snow sledging can be experienced include Solang Valley in Himachal Pradesh and <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/web-stories/snow-in-india-in-march/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Auli in Uttarakhand</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-4-ice-hockey\">4. Ice hockey</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The origins of Ice hockey in Ladakh date back to the 1970s when the Ladakh Scouts Battalion, stationed in the region, innovatively crafted their hockey gear. Using makeshift equipment fashioned from army boots and rubber soles, they laid the foundation for what would become a beloved local tradition.</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"In Ladakh, ice hockey began with army boots and rubber soles.

Today, hockey is more than just a game in Ladakh; it is a spectacle that draws men, women, and children onto the ice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-5-speed-skating\">5. Speed skating</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ladakh is also known for its ice skating. A Bird Group enterprise called iSKATE in partnership with The Hockey Foundation (THF), a New York-based non-profit, operates the ice rink in the Chibra Kargyam village situated at an altitude of 14,350 feet above sea level. This 60mx30m ice rink is the <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/132697/winter-sports-ladakh-highest-ice-rink/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">&lsquo;highest&rsquo; ice rink </a>in the world. The ideal time for skating starts from late December to early February.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So, what are you waiting for?

He filled his truck with diesel and topped up with petrol. Then he entered the station and ordered a couple of iced coffees. When he went to pay, things went sideways.</p><p>Crawley had transferred all his <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/money-quotes/\">money</a> to a new bank account the night before and realized he didn’t have his new bank card on him. He tried to pay from a joint account but, for the life of him, could not remember the PIN.</p><p>“After searching through my iPhone bank app to figure out how to reset my PIN I had failed,” Crawley <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tyson.crawley/posts/pfbid02aPhBbZjH8JnRLjfbYnQJ26w9FeRhgfk62tghon6zzREzmtcHtnyWNPJe6MGyCf1Dl\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recalled in a Facebook post</a>. “My dog was barking wildly, I had to get to work, and I was starting to freak.”</p><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/single-mom-gives-stranger-money-christmas-the-rock/\" target=\"_self\">Single Mom Gives Stranger $7 for Christmas – Then, He Leads Her to the Parking Lot</a></p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Surprise: A Stranger Had Him Covered</strong></h2><p>As Crawley began panicking, a man who had purchased a coffee right before him and exited the store witnessed the ordeal. He came back inside.</p><p>“Do you need some money?” he asked.</p><p>Crawley said no, that he just couldn’t remember his code, and it was okay. The man said it was fine, and then walked around to the register. When Crawley realized what he was doing, he insisted it was okay; he had the money but just needed to figure out his PIN.</p><p>“It’s a free country, isn’t it?” the stranger asked. “I can help a brother out, can’t I?”</p><p>Crawley was stunned. The bill was $110, but eventually, he accepted the <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/kindness-quotes/\">kind</a> man’s help. He then passed him the receipt and asked him to write down his number so that he could contact him and pay him back immediately.</p><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/reddit-comment-stranger-leave-abusive-relationship/\" target=\"_self\">Stranger Gives Woman Advice About Her Toxic Relationship – Receives an Unexpected Email From Her 6 Years Later</a></p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Final Twist: A Follow-Up Request</strong></h2><p>The attendant, whom Crawley said was just as stunned as he was, passed the man a pen. The stranger wrote on it, folded it down, and handed it to Crawley. Crawley was so overwhelmed and grateful that he insisted they take a photo together. Then the man left. </p><p>“I turned around to the attendant and she said, ‘Well that doesn’t happen every day,’” Crawley recalled. “I turned around to leave, and he was gone, literally gone. I went outside and could not see him anywhere.”</p><p>It was then that Crawley opened the receipt to look at the number and he received another shock. Instead of a phone number, the man had written down his name along with three game-changing words.</p><p>“John. Pass it on.”</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"pass it on written a receipt\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f6725\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/pass-it-on-written-a-receipt.png?id=54995389&amp;width=980\" />\n<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tyson.crawley/posts/pfbid02aPhBbZjH8JnRLjfbYnQJ26w9FeRhgfk62tghon6zzREzmtcHtnyWNPJe6MGyCf1Dl\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tyson Crawley / Facebook</a></small></p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Paying It Forward</strong></h2><p>Crawley wrapped his Facebook post with an important reminder.</p><blockquote>“Please be beautiful people, and remember it's not about keeping up with the joneses, having the biggest house, most expensive car, the largest bank account, but work with each other, after all, what is money compared to the quality of human life?” he wrote.</blockquote><p>Money comes and goes, but who we are as people and how we interact with one another is the essence of our being. Helping each other out when times are tough, even when we don’t know the person, is what makes us human, and what can make this life so beautiful.</p><p>So the next time you’re in a position to pay it forward, why not? Go ahead and buy that coffee for the person behind you. Pay that parking meter that’s about to expire for a total stranger. Donate toys to a toy drive, leave a super generous tip, or give a secret gift.</p><p>At the end of the day, it’s how we show up for each other and help one another out that matters. Everything else is just extra. <3</p>",

The unknown, the concealed, the enigmatic, these are the elements that infuse our lives with intrigue and charm. This article delves into the captivating world of mystery, exploring its ability to amplify our appeal and the practical ways in which we can cultivate an aura of mystery around ourselves.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2>The Magnetic Appeal of Mystery</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Mankind has been perennially intrigued by the unseen and the unknown. From ancient myths to contemporary cinema, the concept of mystery has captivated our collective imagination. But what exactly makes mystery so attractive?</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>The Thrill of the Unseen</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Human beings are innately inquisitive creatures. We are drawn towards the unexplored and the unexplained. When someone carries an air of mystery, it incites this natural curiosity, compelling us to learn more about them.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>The Intrigue of Unpredictability</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Mystery adds a dash of unpredictability to our interactions. When we don't disclose everything about ourselves, it leaves room for surprising revelations and unexpected depths, creating an emotionally engaging experience for others.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>The Engagement of Imagination</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Mystery invites others to engage their imagination to fill in the blanks. This active involvement of imagination makes an individual and their narrative more captivating and interesting.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>The Stimulation of Novelty</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Novelty and variety stimulate our brains. When we maintain an element of mystery, it infuses our interactions with novelty, keeping them fresh and stimulating.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>The Allure of Differentiation</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The mystery sets us apart from the predictable crowd. This differentiation is psychologically appealing and can enhance our social attraction.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>The Depth of Connection</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The gradual unveiling of our personality over time can lead to deeper, more meaningful connections. This slow self-disclosure can foster profound relationships.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>The Excitement of Anticipation</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Anticipation is a potent psychological motivator. When people are curious about you and what you might reveal next, they look forward to interactions with you with heightened interest.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>The Power of Control</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>By controlling the information you disclose about yourself, you can maintain a sense of control in social interactions. This can boost your confidence and self-assurance.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2>Crafting Your Aura of Mystery: Practical Tips</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Cultivating an aura of mystery requires a delicate balance. Here are some practical tips that can help you achieve this balance and enhance your appeal through mystery.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>Moderate Self-Disclosure</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>While it's natural to share about ourselves, excessive self-disclosure can dilute our mystery. Striking a balance between sharing and withholding information can help maintain an intriguing aura.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>Encourage Others to Share</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>People enjoy talking about themselves. Encourage them to share by asking questions and showing genuine interest. This not only keeps the spotlight on them but also makes you a more likable conversationalist.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>Be Knowledgeable</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Having a broad range of knowledge can help you keep conversations interesting and avoid awkward silences. It also sparks curiosity about how and why you possess such a wide array of information.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>Engage in Topics of Their Interest</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Showing a willingness to engage in topics of others' interest can bridge gaps and create connections. It can also make you a more engaging conversationalist and add to your mysterious appeal.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>Make Others Feel Special</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Making others feel special and valued can enhance your appeal. It introduces an element of unpredictability in your interactions, making you more intriguing.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>Use Absence Wisely</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>While constant availability can decrease our value, strategic absence can enhance it. However, it's crucial not to disappear too soon or too often, as it might lead to being forgotten.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>Smile</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>A warm, genuine smile can create a positive impression, making you appear more approachable and attractive. It adds to your overall appeal while keeping the mystery alive.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In the end, cultivating an aura of mystery is an art. It requires a delicate balance of revealing and concealing, of engaging and withdrawing, of knowing and learning. But when done right, it can greatly enhance your appeal, making every interaction with you a fascinating journey into the unknown.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:separator --></p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n<!-- /wp:separator --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><em>Hi, my name is Ryoga.

In our quest to conquer these productivity killers, we can take a lesson from the brain's mighty motivator: dopamine.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Whether you’re postponing cleaning your room, <a href=\"https://rayslifestylefield.com/why-do-exercise-needs-vary-between-individuals/\" target=\"_blank\">working out</a>, or any other task you wish to accomplish, your dopamine levels have something to do with that procrastination.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In this article, we'll delve into the role of dopamine, uncover its secrets, and explore how we can reverse engineer it to help us overcome procrastination and achieve peak productivity in our daily lives.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2>What is Dopamine?</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>To embark on this journey towards increasing our productivity, let's first understand dopamine.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In the world of neuroscience,<strong> dopamine is a neurotransmitter often responsible for the \"feel-good\" feeling, as well as that of reward, pleasure, and motivation within our brains.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>It's the chemical messenger responsible for keeping us coming back for more of life's little joys. Think of it as the craving that fuels your drive to take action, that \"feel-good\" sensation when you accomplish something.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>For example, picture that rush of happiness and desire to dance when a catchy song comes on, or the sense of accomplishment and relaxation we feel after meditation – these are all healthy releases of dopamine.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Similar healthy releases of dopamine include:</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:list --></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Listening to music</li>\n<li>Yoga</li>\n<li>Meditation</li>\n<li>Conversations</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rayslifestylefield.com/benefits-of-sauna-after-workout/\" target=\"_blank\">Sauna</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2>The Dark Side of Dopamine</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>While dopamine is a productivity booster, it can also lead us down the path of procrastination. The issue arises when we fall prey to instant gratification, such as watching cute cat videos online or mindlessly scrolling through TikTok.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>These activities offer quick rushes of pleasure, and our brains quickly become addicted to them, simply because they are effortless and their reward is almost instant.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The opposite of that would be delayed gratification, an action that requires a little bit more willpower.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>When given a choice between an immediate reward, such as indulging in high-carb food or mindlessly scrolling on your phone, and a delayed one, like the long-term benefits of regular exercise or a skincare routine with results that take time to manifest, your brain tends to favor the habit of immediate gratification.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>This sets the stage for a never-ending cycle of procrastination, where we prioritize short-term satisfaction over long-term gains.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>How often have you found yourself postponing important tasks in favor of swiping on your phone or binge-watching Netflix?&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Both provide dopamine and satisfaction, but scrolling requires far less effort. It's much easier to move your fingers than to tackle chores or workouts.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2>Breaking the Vicious Cycle</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>You may have heard the advice, \"Just put your phone away,\" but that's only a short-term solution, as well as not being helpful at all. The craving for dopamine will only lead you back to your phone. Instead, we need a more strategic approach.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Setting a \"phone curfew\" or screen-time limits can help, but these can also be bypassed. Never underestimate the creativity of a brain when we feel lazy!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>We could try more extreme measures such as never entering the cycle in the first place. How? By re-designing our environment to put us in the best conditions possible to become productive.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>For example, if we always watch TV instead of cleaning our room, we could remove the TV from our room and relocate it somewhere else. If we always watch TikTok videos before sending important emails on our phones, we could remove the application completely. But that process is long and requires effort, commitment, and a great deal of willpower that we don’t have at the moment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>So, how exactly do we tackle laziness and procrastination effectively, if everything I mentioned won’t solve the problem?</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>There are many ways to get things done. If you’re a woman looking for an innovative way to become productive, then the book How To Get Sh*t Done is a great way to start!</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2>The Reverse Engineer Technique</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Renowned neuroscientist <a href=\"https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter/tools-to-manage-dopamine-and-improve-motivation-and-drive\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Huberman</a> talks about a remarkable side of dopamine. Beyond being the source of satisfaction, dopamine is also released during an action, particularly when we feel we're doing something right: ‘’Dopamine is what’s released anytime an animal or human thinks it's on the right path, and that’s very subjective’’.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Think of it as momentum – once you start releasing dopamine, it impacts your mood and motivation, pushing you to do more. This energy surge is similar to the euphoria after a workout or completing a challenging task. The sense of being on the right path fuels your desire for more.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>It's no wonder the saying \"If you want something done, give it to someone busy\" rings true. Once you start, you are a different person.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Now, armed with the knowledge that dopamine has a momentum effect, how can we leverage it to conquer procrastination and phone scrolling? Huberman's wisdom reveals that <strong>by doing something even more demanding than the task you're avoiding, you can propel yourself into a productive state.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Picture this scenario: you're postponing room cleaning by aimlessly scrolling through your phone. To overcome this hurdle, engage in a task that you find enjoyable and more challenging.<a href=\"https://rayslifestylefield.com/why-do-exercise-needs-vary-between-individuals/\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rayslifestylefield.com/why-do-exercise-needs-vary-between-individuals/\" target=\"_blank\">If you're into physical exercise</a>, go for a run. If you’re into literature, read a book.&nbsp; The sheer accomplishment and the \"right path\" feeling associated with the challenging act release dopamine. We can all agree that running is more demanding than tidying a room. Once you've conquered the former, the latter will seem like a breeze, and you'll finish it in no time!</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>You can also engage in more mentally challenging exercises to start your dopamine momentum. Actions such as getting on an important phone call, organizing a trip, or contacting an old friend are all great examples.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>The actions are not necessarily important, what’s important is to complete them!&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>Steps to take to overcome laziness using the reverse-engineer technique:</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} --></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Realize that you are postponing an activity.</li>\n<li>Think of anything you like to do that is deemed challenging and engage in that activity (preparing a recipe, going for a run, re-arranging a part of your house).</li>\n<li>Once completed, use that momentum and short success to tackle your original postponed activity.</li>\n<li>Feel free to take on any task that comes to mind!</li>\n</ol>\n<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In your pursuit of conquering laziness and procrastination, understanding the role of dopamine in your brain can be a game-changer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>By strategically outsmarting your brain with tasks that are both harder and enjoyable, you can unleash a surge of productivity that will empower you to breeze through your daily to-do list.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Remember, procrastination is a common struggle, and it's okay to confront it head-on. Implement the strategies outlined in this article, and be patient with yourself.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Break free from the grip of laziness and procrastination, unlock your full potential, and achieve your goals. The next time you catch yourself mindlessly scrolling on your phone or indulging in Netflix, you'll know exactly what to do!</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>----------</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><em>Check out more of Rayen's work at his blog: <a href=\"https://rayslifestylefield.com/why-do-exercise-needs-vary-between-individuals/\" target=\"_blank\">Ray's Lifestyle Field </a></em></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/the-reverse-engineer-technique-to-master-productivity/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Reverse Engineer Technique to Master Productivity</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.pickthebrain.com/blog\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pick the Brain | Motivation and Self Improvement</a>.</p>",

Her father worried not about her talent, but about the cost: &ldquo;How would I afford a specialised diet or equipment?&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Yet her mother&rsquo;s quiet determination, paired with coach Vijay Hooda&rsquo;s belief, changed everything. At age 12, Minakshi joined a local <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/318215/delhi-boxer-rohit-tokas-won-bronze-medal-commonwealth-games-2022-despite-knee-injuries/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">boxing academy </a>run by Vijay. He spotted her raw talent, bought her first kit, ensured she had the diet she needed, and persuaded her hesitant father to let her train.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Once Srikrishan saw his daughter in the ring, there was no turning back. He ferried her daily, borrowed money for tournaments, and stood ringside as her loudest supporter. Over time, her early successes &mdash; sub-junior wins, a Khelo India School Games title, Youth Nationals gold in 2019 &mdash; showed that the investment was paying off.</span></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\">\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOukwKiiOOU/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;\" target=\"_blank\">\n<div style=\"display: flex;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;\">\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div>\n</div>\n</a>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; white-space: nowrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOukwKiiOOU/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by The Better India (@thebetterindia)</a></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>\n\n</span></p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Climbing the ranks</span></h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Minakshi moved up through the categories.

After living together for months, Wittig would discover that he and the boy he adopted, Ronnie, shared a special bond, as reported by <a href=\"https://people.com/doctor-raises-teen-whose-parents-died-my-extraordinary-family-7565055\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PEOPLE</a>.</p><p>Wittig was shown a snapshot of two osteosarcoma patients he had treated in the early 1980s, over 25 years ago. Both of the women in the photo had the same type of bone cancer but received different treatments: one had a limb amputated, while the other had limb-sparing surgery.</p><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\">\n            <div style=\"padding: 8px;\">\n                <div style=\"line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;\">\n                    <div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\">\n                    <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CofS2EzuO_K/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=189a0055-8331-4239-8912-816af5d36816\" style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_top\">See on Instagram</a>\n                </p>\n                \n            </div>\n        </blockquote><p>Wittig was a fellow when he cared for the patient whose limb was saved. When her doctor, the fellowship director, retired, Wittig took over as her doctor. Wittig, the Chairman of the Department of Orthopedics at Morristown Medical Center, has used this photograph for years when giving lectures and instructing residents. The image depicted \"limb-saving surgery and osteosarcoma.\"</p><p>He never met or treated the second woman in the photos, despite having a professional relationship with the woman whose leg was saved. However, after she passed away, he raised her son. Wittig, who remained in contact with his former patient, noticed on Facebook in 2015 that she was looking for someone to care for a kid named Ronnie, the son of a friend who died as a result of complications after her amputation. The boy's father had also lately died. He contacted the patient and inquired about adopting the boy.</p><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\">\n            <div style=\"padding: 8px;\">\n                <div style=\"line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;\">\n                    <div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\">\n                    <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CmmqctUO_B5/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=d5ff3f12-ef4a-4edd-9e23-6820942a78b9\" style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_top\">See on Instagram</a>\n                </p>\n                \n            </div>\n        </blockquote><p>In February 2015, Wittig drove from his home near Morristown, New Jersey, to northern Virginia to meet the youngster in person. Soon after that encounter, his patient called to say Ronnie wanted to meet Wittig's family. Wittig learned the youngster had elected to live with him hours after the second visit. Ronnie's legal guardianship was transferred to Wittig two weeks later.</p><p>Wittig recognized the boy's mother as the other woman in the photograph he had used in presentations for many years after they had been living together for a few months. The coincidence convinced him that this link was predestined. \"I see this whole thing as a synchronicity,\" he explained. Ronnie struck him as \"one of the strongest and kindest and most courageous kids.\" Ronnie went on to attend Seton Hall Prep and completed welding school.</p><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\">\n            <div style=\"padding: 8px;\">\n                <div style=\"line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;\">\n                    <div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\">\n                    <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Ceb_Q6CuH7M/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=396d3bfe-a47f-4b2d-95b8-42bbeaa706a5\" style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_top\">See on Instagram</a>\n                </p>\n                \n            </div>\n        </blockquote><p>Wittig has yet to legally adopt Ronnie, now an adult, but believes the process will be completed in a year or two. He hinted that their relationship is more than just a piece of paper. Being a parent with a child to \"love\" and \"care about\" has been \"so fulfilling\" for the oncologist. He mentors and leads him through life while also learning from him. Wittig says his son has taught him \"kindness, compassion, empathy, love, joy, and happiness\" in spades.</p><p>He wrote about Ronnie on his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CofS2EzuO_K/?img_index=4\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>, \"6 years ago today, I had the best thing happen to me, becoming your Dad! It’s one of the biggest miracles in my life, and I am so proud to call you my son! Proud of all you have accomplished and the person you have become! You are amazing to me and my hero! I am always here for you, my son! Love you, buddy!\" He believes that his tale may inspire other older, single men and women who desire to have children to realize that it is not too late.</p><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\">\n            <div style=\"padding: 8px;\">\n                <div style=\"line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;\">\n                    <div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\">\n                    <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CkpB0XgMpwC/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=766c611e-00a0-4424-ae87-a91f122807f5\" style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_top\">See on Instagram</a>\n                </p>\n                \n            </div>\n        </blockquote><p><em>This article originally appeared 2 years ago.</em></p>",

One might show up to help or check in, not realizing the other person has already been doing something kind for them. It’s just something that happens when both people care, and is exactly what took place when Annarela Martinez was in the middle of organizing a <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/wife-throws-husband-epic-surprise-45th-birthday-party-at-costco\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">surprise birthday party</a> for her boyfriend. Decorations were up, guests were waiting quietly, and everything was set for him to walk through the door and be surprised. But what she didn't know was that her boyfriend would show up with <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/flower-girl-falls-asleep-three-guys-step-in-to-be-flower-bros\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">flowers</a>. She shared the moment on her TikTok account <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@annarelamartinez/video/7500759949946113326\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@annarelamartinez.</a></p><h2>A small gesture that said a lot</h2>        <p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"56b9d\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjA4Mjg0MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5NjM5NDcxMX0.2NA83SNAgsQ2YUsO_NYANaWBRAQrdQY2bQZkGVStlhA/img.jpg?width=980\" />                <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">He was completely unprepared. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">TikTok | @annarelamartinez</small>        </p>            <p>The boyfriend showed up earlier than expected because he thought she was having a rough day. As she explained in the video, \"Me trying to throw my bf a surprise birthday party while he thinks I had a bad day and brings me flowers to cheer me up.\" When she opened the door, he was standing there with a bouquet, completely unaware of the surprise behind him. Her reaction said it all. She was caught off guard, smiled, and quickly tried to manage the moment without giving anything away. A few seconds later, the surprise went ahead as planned — friends jumped out, the celebration started, and he finally understood why she looked so shocked.</p><h2>Why mutual support matters</h2>        <p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">        <img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"76cb9\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjA4Mjg1NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgxNzM3NjU3OH0.2tdkaRLKKztOzPtErsMccvGFk3XGeK0UD2jA-kN2hyg/img.jpg?width=980\" />                <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">TikTok | @annarelamartinez</small>        </p>            <p>For many people watching the video, what stood out wasn’t the party — it was the way he walked in thinking of her. He didn’t know what she was planning, and he had no idea the evening was meant to celebrate him. He just thought she needed a small gesture to feel better. This moment highlights the concept of mutual support in relationships. A study published in the <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/02654075251336872\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Journal of Social and Personal Relationships</a> found that both giving and receiving emotional support contribute to lower levels of depressive symptoms in couples.

The city had a number of apothecaries with soda fountains, as well as confectioners serving countless carbonated concoctions—some claiming to cure a variety of ailments, and others simply providing customers with something sweet and refreshing to drink.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enter the nectar soda. The flavor is a combination of vanilla and bitter almond, and the drink is pastel pink in color—a nod to the hue of almond flowers, according to </span><a href=\"https://dannwoellertthefoodetymologist.wordpress.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dann Woellert</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a Cincinnati food historian, etymologist, and the author of </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cincinnati-Candy-History-American-Palate/dp/1467137952\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cincinnati Candy: A Sweet History</span></em></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Nicknamed the “</span><a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/hnpcincinnatienquirershell/historical-newspapers/august-2-1942-page-55-108/docview/1882746511/sem-2?accountid=39387\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">drink of the gods</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” the bitter almond flavor of nectar soda balances out what would otherwise be overly sweet vanilla, creating an addictive taste that grows on you with each sip. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nectar sodas have been served in Cincinnati since at least the late 1870s, though, like many iconic foods and beverages, its precise origins are murky. The only other U.S. city to embrace nectar sodas was New Orleans, but unlike Cincinnati, the tradition fizzled out in the Big Easy in the mid-20th century. Plus, Woellert says that the Queen City popularized them first. “They were served in Cincinnati nearly a decade before New Orleans,” he says.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the Cincinnati nectar soda has multiple origin stories, each crediting a different pharmacist or confectioner, Woellert has concluded that </span><a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/hnpcincinnatienquirershell/historical-newspapers/april-13-1947-page-98-151/docview/1882885311/sem-2?accountid=39387\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Mullane</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> created the flavor after traveling to Quebec City to learn the art of confectionery from a prominent Canadian candymaker. He began serving nectar sodas in his confectionery shop in downtown Cincinnati in the late 1870s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, why did the nectar soda end up in Cincinnati and New Orleans, of all places? Wollert suspects that the bitter almond and vanilla flavor was used by the French Acadians who settled in both Quebec City and New Orleans.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though nectar sodas aren’t as common as they were in the early 20th century, when they could be found at countless confectioneries and pharmacy soda fountains across Cincinnati, they’re still served at establishments throughout the city and the surrounding area. Nectar sodas have been on the menu at ice cream and chocolate shop </span><a href=\"https://www.aglamesis.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aglamesis Brothers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since it opened in Cincinnati in 1908, if not shortly thereafter. That’s according to company president and CEO Randy Young, who is also a third-generation family member. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s unclear when nectar sodas were added to the </span><a href=\"https://digital.cincinnatilibrary.org/digital/collection/p16998coll32/id/2220/rec/19\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">menu</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at </span><a href=\"https://www.graeters.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graeter’s</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a Cincinnati ice cream and chocolate shop that opened in 1870 and now has locations throughout the city and the Midwest, but Chip Graeter, chief of retail operations and a fourth-generation family member, says that they were especially popular throughout the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a </span><a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/hnpcincinnatienquirershell/historical-newspapers/january-28-1947-page-2-26/docview/1882876222/sem-2?accountid=39387\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">January 28, 1947 article</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cincinnati Enquirer</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Tom Moore, the head of the soda department at Dow Drug Store—which operated 32 soda fountains throughout the metropolitan area at that time—said that “nectar is one of the most popular flavors in all of their stores, and has been for many years.” Five years prior, </span><a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/hnpcincinnatienquirershell/historical-newspapers/august-16-1942-page-63-99/docview/1882739776/sem-2?accountid=39387\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow ran an ad</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the same newspaper which read: “Be glad you live in Cincinnati, the only place in the country where you can enjoy a Dow double-dip nectar soda.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Originally, nectar syrup was made by combining half-and-half or milk with water, bitter almond extract, vanilla extract and red food coloring. While Aglamesis eventually switched to a dairy-free shelf-stable syrup, Graeter's recipe has never changed—it still contains milk and needs to be refrigerated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Aglamesis and Graeter’s make nectar soda by mixing nectar syrup with a dollop of whipped cream, adding a scoop or two of vanilla ice cream, then topping it off with some soda water and more whipped cream.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Young says that nectar sodas are most popular with older adults, they’re also a hit with members of younger generations who try them. “People who grew up with them still love them today,” Graeter says. “We still make them in all of our stores, but they're not nearly as popular today as they once were, simply because milkshakes and smoothies have taken over.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Young, there is a commercially available descendant of </span><a href=\"https://www.coca-cola.com/us/en/brands/barq-s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the nectar soda</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “Commercial soda companies like Barqs and others came out with their version of cream soda—a bright pink soda—which got its flavoring from nectar soda,” he explains.</span></p>",

They know the principles of argumentative writing inside and out, and they use them.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>For others, those principles can become an efficient practice to enhance self-confidence. Even when keeping a journal, <a href=\"https://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/happens-life-write-goals/\">writing a diary</a>, or practicing reflective essays, you can implement three fundamental principles of argumentative writing to grow communication skills, <a href=\"https://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/self-esteem-are-you-actually-that-bad/\">self-esteem</a>, and attitude toward yourself.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>What are these principles? How can you implement them in the writing practices aimed at self-reflection? Is written persuasion helpful?</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Let's get this straight.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2>Principle 1: Understanding the Topic</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>To construct a convincing argument, writers should understand the topic they describe. They don't simply sit and put words on paper but do research and gather relevant information from credible sources.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>What does it have to do with your self-confidence?</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Make it a habit to use the above principle of <a href=\"https://bid4papers.com/blog/how-to-write-an-argumentative-essay/\" target=\"_blank\">argumentative writing</a> whenever you need to discuss something and persuade an interlocutor. Don't start a discussion without strong evidence at hand.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>When you write or talk about something previously researched, you'll feel more confident in what you say.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>How to use this principle of argumentative writing?</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Start by delving into the topic and uncovering different viewpoints. Look for reputable sources such as scholarly articles, books, and reliable websites to support your claims. Collect evidence and examples that reinforce your position.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Sure:</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>You will only do that sometimes before meeting with a friend. It's your leisure time, after all.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Yet, this principle is worth considering when writing a blog or social media post to express your position on a particular issue.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Also, it can come in handy during a job interview. Or when you network with experts in your niche and want to look professional and confident in your message.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Dive deeper into the topic by identifying key terms and concepts. Analyze the underlying issues and complexities involved, allowing you to provide a more nuanced argument. This comprehensive understanding will enable you to speak confidently about the subject matter.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2>Principle 2: Structuring Your Argument</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The structure of your argument matters:</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>By logically organizing your thoughts and ideas, you create a roadmap that guides the audience through it.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>Think of your argument as if it's a well-structured essay:</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} --></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Start with a compelling hook to grab the audience's attention. (It can be an intriguing fact or a thought-provoking question on the topic.)</li>\n<li>Provide context for your audience to understand your point and state your thesis (the main argument why — <em>or why not</em> — you support the issue).</li>\n<li>Use logical reasoning and critical thinking to strengthen your claims. Present your supporting evidence to be more confident about what you say. Additionally, you can address counterarguments to showcase your ability to evaluate opposing viewpoints and refute them effectively.</li>\n<li>Summarize everything and emphasize the significance of your arguments again. You can restate your thesis once again. Also, think of some food for thought for the audience: Encourage further reflection.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2>Principle 3: Persuasive Language and Rhetoric</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The language and rhetoric you use have a powerful impact on how persuasive your argument is. By employing persuasive techniques and rhetorical devices, you can enhance the overall effectiveness of your writing or speech.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Ensure you choose the right words to convey your ideas with precision and impact. Utilize strong and precise vocabulary to articulate your points convincingly. Avoid vague or ambiguous language that may weaken your arguments or leave room for misinterpretation.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Rhetorical devices help you appeal to your readers on different levels and establish a connection with them. Utilize pathos to evoke emotions, such as empathy or sympathy, and engage the reader's sentiments.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Incorporate logical reasoning through logos to present facts, statistics, and logical deductions. Additionally, establish credibility through ethos by showcasing your expertise or citing reputable sources.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>What are logos, ethos, and pathos?</strong> They are techniques of persuasion, and they form a rhetorical triangle that speakers, writers, and advertisers use to craft compelling arguments:</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} --></p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Pathos</em> — appealing to emotions</li>\n<li><em>Logos</em> — appealing to reasoning and arguments</li>\n<li><em>Ethos</em> — appealing to your status and authority</li>\n</ol>\n<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>(More details <a href=\"https://fs.blog/ethos-logos-pathos/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.)</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>Anything else can you try to sound confident?</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Enhance the persuasiveness of your arguments by employing persuasive techniques such as analogy or anecdote. The former helps simplify complex ideas by drawing comparisons, while the latter provides real-life examples that resonate with readers. Furthermore, structure your sentences and paragraphs effectively to create a compelling flow that maintains the reader's interest.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2>So?</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Implementing the above principles, you can boost your self-confidence as an argumentative writer and a pleasing interlocutor:</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Understanding the topic and developing a comprehensive argument builds confidence in articulating your ideas effectively.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>A well-structured argument provides clarity and direction, empowering you to communicate your thoughts confidently.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Employing persuasive language and rhetoric strengthens your case and bolsters your confidence in your writing abilities.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>Applying these principles also enhances your overall soft skills:</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:list --></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Critical thinking: </em>Engaging in in-depth research and analysis improves your ability to gather relevant information and critically evaluate different perspectives.</li>\n<li><em>Self-organization: </em>By structuring your argument effectively, you develop organizational skills and create a logical flow that captivates readers.</li>\n<li><em>Rhetorical skills:</em> Choosing words thoughtfully and employing rhetorical devices develops your language skills and enhances your ability to convey your ideas persuasively.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Do you practice argumentative writing when journaling or posting on social media?

That's the case with <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/2020/11/25/miley-cyrus-cody-simpson-breakup-realization/\">Miley Cyrus</a> and her sister Noah Cyrus, who is 7 years her junior.</p><p>While Miley rose to fame on the Disney Channel as <em>Hannah Montana </em>and later took the music scene by storm,<em> </em>in recent years Noah Cyrus began releasing music too. But back in May, while discussing the release of her EP, <em>The End of Everything</em>, Noah <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a32580033/noah-cyrus-young-and-sad-miley-cyrus-sister/\" target=\"_blank\">recalled emotionally</a> what it was like to grow up as Miley Cyrus's little sister. “It was absolutely unbearable,” she said.</p><p>“Whenever I was younger, there were a lot of comparisons and there were a lot of things said about me and the way I look that destroyed me becoming an adult,” <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/noah-cyrus-the-heartbreaking-thing-that-changed-miley-cyruss-sisters-life-when-she-was-seven.html/\" target=\"_blank\">Noah has said</a>. </p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-custom1\" id=\"cite0\">That destroyed my view of myself. That wouldn’t have happened if I wasn’t a public person since birth. That wasn’t my choice. I love my family but everybody has their issues. This was mine. It really f***ed me up.<br /><cite>Noah Cyrus</cite></blockquote><p><div class=\"rm-shortcode\">\n<div class=\"jwplayer-media\" id=\"botr_yh17SUWU_IXU6no1G_div\">\n<img class=\"jwplayer-media-preview\" src=\"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/yh17SUWU-1920.jpg\" />\n</div>\n\n</div></p><h2>Noah Cyrus was 'in the shadows' of sister Miley</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\"><img alt=\"Miley cyrus noah 1024x574\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"2aa99\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/miley-cyrus-noah-1024x574.jpg?id=51947808&amp;width=980\" /></figure><p>Although a talented musician on her own, Noah had trouble growing up with Billy Ray Cyrus as her dad and Miley as her older sister. Noah said she wrote the song, “Young and Sad,” based on the experience of growing up hidden in her sister’s “shadows.”</p><p>The song goes a little something like this:</p><p>“My sister's like sunshine / Always bringing good light wherever she'll go / And I was born to rain clouds / Blessed in her shadows.”</p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-custom1\" id=\"cite1\">That's why everybody always says to me, that no matter what, I was going to be in that shadow. And I always believed that, and that's so hard for me to overcome.<br /><cite>Noah Cyrus</cite></blockquote><p>“Being born in the family I was in, everybody gave me such a hard time for having a hard time being Miley's little sister, but I always felt like I was that person that no one gave a shit about due to what people said to me online,” <a href=\"https://tearfully\" target=\"_blank\">she said</a>, while shedding tears. </p><p>Hopefully, now that she has been more open about her feelings, she is able to start healing from that early trauma. After all, opening up about one’s feelings, no matter how hard they are to express—and no matter how much judgement one might face for doing so—typically does wonders for the healing process.</p><p>With all that said, Miley and Noah have a close relationship. Contrary to popular belief, there is no bitter rivalry. Sure, they’ve gone through tough times together, but who hasn't – both sisters are completely honest about that.</p><h3>Noah Cyrus and Miley Cyrus set an example for sisterhood</h3><p>These days, both Noah and Miley put out amazing music and bolster one another as they’re doing it.</p><p>To date, Noah has released 2 EPs, 18 singles, and 4 promotional singles. Last January, for Noah’s birthday, Miley took to Instagram to showcase several of Noah’s singles in honour of her sister. But what garnered the most interest about Miley’s selection was her decision to share the artwork from “Love or Die,” Noah’s 2018 song with her now-ex, rapper <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/what-does-noah-cyrus-think-of-lil-xan-becoming-a-father.html/\" target=\"_blank\">Lil Xan</a>. As a caption, Cyrus wrote, “Controversial to still love this song? Might delete later.” </p><p>As the story goes, Noah dated Lil Xan from June to September 2018, and it was a complete hot mess of a drama within weeks, what with accusations of cheating flying both ways, and Lil Xan’s anxiety and drug use being far too much to handle. Miley has always <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyCAcT85lS8&amp;ab_channel=HollywoodLife\" target=\"_blank\">stood up for her sis</a>, claiming that Lil Xan <em>did</em> cheat on Noah, and then tried to turn it around by accusing her of the same. “It's sickening the way he’s trying to manipulate Noah and mess with her mind,” she said, adding that she wanted to help her sister get through the breakup, as that she's better off without him.</p><p>When it comes to her sister's solo singing career, Miley has <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/miley-cyrus-noah-music-industry\" target=\"_blank\">expressed real joy</a>. “She didn’t even tell me that this was really happening all of a sudden, which I think she wanted to really do it on her own. So I’m really proud of her that she did. I think she really didn’t involve me as much… I think she just wanted to get out on her own two feet without this having anything to do with me.” </p><p>In fact, Miley even <a href=\"https://www.thethings.com/miley-noah-cyrus-relationship/#:~:text=2%20The%20Sisters%20Are%208,makes%20no%20difference%20for%20them!\" target=\"_blank\">got on TikTok</a> and did some dancing to promote Noah's song “The End of Everything,”<em> </em>and Noah has done the same for Miley on multiple occasions. These are sisters who build each other up and offer support—in matters of heartbreak and music alike. </p><p>Not to mention, Miley never took her sister’s expressions of hardship as the youngest in their family personally: she’s wise enough to know that it’s not about her. Impressively, these two have managed to be honest about their less than sunny feelings while still nurturing a close bond. I’d go one further and say that honesty makes you vulnerable, which in turn strengthens any bond that's worth having.</p><p>Miley, having experienced life on the road as a musician for many years now, has said that Noah’s budding career has made her more relatable. “Now having someone that really understands how hard it can be when you’re away from home for a month, me and my little sister have a new bond over that,” <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/miley-cyrus-noah-music-industry\" target=\"_blank\">she said</a>.</p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-custom1\" id=\"cite2\">She loves me more now that she knows I do something. She always thought I do nothing and that I went to put two wigs on.<br /><cite>Miley Cyrus</cite></blockquote><p>Now, it seems, that Noah gets firsthand how much time and energy goes into being famous, the sisters’ empathy for one another has only grown.<br /></p><p>Back in October, Noah took to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CGyumgmJY6z/?utm_source=ig_embed\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> to express how excited she was to have included a song with her big sister among the tracks on <em>The End of Everything</em>. “No one knows how happy and excited Miley and I are to be releasing something TOGETHER for our VERY FIRST TIME!!!! And it’s NOT the last,” she wrote. </p><p>This collaboration is the ultimate result of a strong relationship among sisters who are both doing their darnedest to grow and evolve together, rather than separately.</p><p><strong>More inspiring celebrities:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/2020/11/25/miley-cyrus-cody-simpson-breakup-realization/\">After Yet Another Breakup, Miley Cyrus Finally Realized Her One Mistake</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/2020/11/25/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-relationship-proves-growth-maturity/\">Why Taylor Swift’s Secret Relationship With Joe Alwyn Proves She Finally Learned Her Lesson</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/2020/11/23/jennifer-aniston-john-mayer-breakup-comments-friendship/\">Here’s what Jennifer Aniston Did When Her Ex John Mayer Attacked Her</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/2020/10/15/jennifer-lopez-marc-anthony-divorce-realization/\">What Finally Convinced Jennifer Lopez That She Needed A Divorce From Marc Anthony</a></li></ul>",

She had been at the chain for more than a decade, so it was business as usual for the server when a group of 12 came in to eat. It was not, however, a routine meal for the patrons who came in that day.</p><p>You see, the group had come into the eatery with the intention of spreading <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/kindness-quotes/\">generosity</a>. They were a bunch of church-going friends who wanted to lift someone up ahead of the holidays, and they had hatched a plan.</p><p>In what James Deal described in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2834989263229850&amp;set=pcb.2834998026562307&amp;type=3&amp;theater\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook post</a> as the “1<sup>st</sup> Annual 100 dollar breakfast,” each of the 12 diners left Ballard a $100 tip at the end of the meal. In total, they pooled together $1,200 and put it in a card for their server.</p><p>“I read the card, and it had scriptures on it, which let me know they were good people,” Ballard <a href=\"https://www.today.com/food/cracker-barrel-waitress-blessed-1-200-tip-t169994\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">told <em>Today</em></a>. “They were very genuine individuals.

She couldn’t believe that these strangers had been so generous, and she grew more and more emotional as someone filmed her.  </p><p>“I don’t really like to cry with a camera in my face, but I didn’t even care at this point,” she recalled. “I had 12 total strangers saying, ‘Hey, we care enough about you because of how you made us feel while we were dining and we want to be a blessing to you and your family.'”</p><p>According to Ballard, the <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/5-cognitive-biases-that-affect-your-money-management/\">money</a> was an answer to her prayers. She had needed help paying her taxes and was stressed out about her car payment.

That’s why they posted it on Facebook, where many weighed in on how nice it was to see such generosity, especially so close to the holidays.

After work, she went out for lunch and “blessed” her server with a large tip. Then she treated herself to a pedicure and gave the manicurist a large tip before the appointment began.</p><p>“Because of the gift of love and caring and sharing I’m able to not only be a better Janet, but I am able to be an example for people this time of year who don’t have hope,” she added to <em>Today</em>.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>It's That Time of Year - Do the Unexpected!</strong></h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image image-crop-3x1\">\n<img alt=\"christmas carolers spread cheer\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"1e17f\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/christmas-carolers-spread-cheer.jpg?id=55306467&amp;width=1200&amp;height=400&amp;quality=50&amp;coordinates=0%2C1648%2C0%2C1648\" />\n<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">\n            Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@d_ks11?utm_source=RebelMouse&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Dominic Kurniawan Suryaputra</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=RebelMouse&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a>\n</small>\n</p><p>Sometimes it’s just nice to see good people receive nice things, especially when it comes as a surprise.

It's a living, breathing network of connections and shared experiences. While it's usually defined as “a group of people living in the same place or having a particular characteristic in common,” true community runs much deeper than that.\n</p><p><strong>Diversity</strong></p><p>\n\tIt doesn’t matter how different we are. What matters in building a community is the desire to live in a peaceful and caring environment, despite all our differences.Good Neighbors<br />\n</p><p><strong>Good Neighbors</strong><br /></p><p>\n\tWhen searching for a new place to call home, we hope to stumble upon neighbors who can transform a neighborhood into something meaningful. We all need to be surrounded by people who genuinely care for the well-being of others. Only this type of people can create a community that is more than just a bunch of individuals living next to each other.\n</p><p><strong>It Starts with One</strong><br /></p><p>\n\tBuilding a strong community starts with individual contributions, no matter how small. As long as you are kind and willing to help others in need, you’ll be a great community member. In exchange, your community will give you a sense of belonging and the feeling that you are never alone.\n</p><h2>Here are 35 quotes on what makes communities special — community service, coming together, engagement, involvement, and support</h2><h3>Quotes about community coming together</h3><blockquote id=\"cite0\">One of the marvelous things about community is that it enables us to welcome and help people in a way we couldn't as individuals.<br /><cite>JEAN VANIER</cite></blockquote><blockquote id=\"cite1\">There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about.<br /><cite>MARGARET J.

In reality, many people invest in continuing education and are then stuck paying off student loans for a large chunk of their lives.\n</p><p>\n\tThat’s what happened to Jasmin Ford, a nurse in Chicago. She was dealing with a large debt and struggling to pay it off by working two jobs. Then, something incredible happened to her – the debt vanished. Here's how it all went down.\n</p><h3>A Familiar Story: Graduating With Debt</h3><br /><img alt=\"jasmin ford and her son\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"12dcd\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/jasmin-ford-and-her-son.png?id=54969765&amp;width=980\" /><p><br /></p><h3></h3><br /><p>When Ford received her bachelor’s degree in 2011, she was the first person in her <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/family-quotes/\" target=\"_self\">family</a> to graduate from college. She was proud and didn’t stop there, returning to school to get her nursing degree.</p><p>It was tough, especially since Ford didn’t have any family assistance to help her to pay for things. In order to afford necessities like food and rent, plus her tuition, she relied on student loans, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Living/bank-surprises-single-mom-paying-off-150k-student/story?id=59797289\" target=\"_blank\">reports </a><em><a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Living/bank-surprises-single-mom-paying-off-150k-student/story?id=59797289\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ABC News</a>.</em></p><p>“I could not foresee when I’d be able to pay it off,” Ford told the publication. “I just knew this was going to be a part of my life as long as I was alive unless there was some significant change.”</p><h3>Arrival of Surprising News</h3><br /><p>At 30 years old, Ford was working nearly every day at two jobs and providing for her two-year-old son, Caleb. She didn’t see an end in sight, but then out of nowhere, Fifth Third Bank contacted her and told her it was paying off her $150,000 loans, free and clear.</p><blockquote><strong></strong>“I still can’t find the words [...] I’m off work again today, and I’m just sort of pacing around and restless because I know my life is going to change.” -Jasmin Ford</blockquote><p>The bank had selected Ford after she was chosen to participate in a documentary about student loan debt. She thought the crew was coming to her house to shoot some extra footage when they dropped the news.</p><p>“The documentary in itself was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” she continued. “I’m a South Side of Chicago nurse and I have a kid, that in itself is not that exciting, and I got to be in a documentary and I met some amazing people on the way.”</p><h3>A Life-Changing Moment</h3><br /><p>Ford was surprised by the amazing gesture, and knows it is a game changer for herself and her son.</p><p>“His life will be totally different,” she said. “I’m so happy and so proud that I’m able to offer that to him more than anything else because he deserves it.”</p><p>Looking forward, Ford is excited to pay it forward with her nursing degree, but also just to have more freedom, both <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/mental-health-quotes/\" target=\"_self\">mentally</a> and physically. She wants to spend less time hustling and more time with her family, all while embracing what comes next.</p><p>“I can open myself to more experiences, opportunities and just be able to sit and be with my thoughts and be able to pursue what it is I came to do,” she added.</p><h3>A Lesson in Perseverance</h3><br /><p>Ford’s story is a perfect example of the fact that while there’s something to be said for pursuing your <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/goals-quotes/\" target=\"_self\">dreams</a> and working hard, the road to success isn’t always easy. In fact, sometimes it feels completely riddled with obstacles that may make you want to give up.</p><p>But sometimes, good things really do happen to good people. Ford wasn’t expecting this level of help, but she knows just how game-changing it is.</p><p>Her story inspires many to hold onto hope and keep stepping forward even when the path is uphill because, in the end, it will somehow work out.</p><p>We just need to hold onto faith and, when times get tough, remember to keep pushing through.</p><h3></h3><br /><p><strong>More from Goalcast:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/man-buys-bank-that-refused-loan-18-years-ago/\" target=\"_self\">Man Buys The Bank That Refused Him A Loan When He Was Broke 18 Years Ago</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/nurse-lottery-mansion-omaze/\" target=\"_self\">Homeless Student Nurse Couch Surfs to Survive–but Christmas Came Early When She Wins $6M Home in Lottery</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/debt-community-facebook-mom-jeans/\" target=\"_self\">Struggling Single Mom With Staggering Debt Decides to Make a Change — And Bring Others With Her</a></li></ul><p></p><div class=\"rm-shortcode\">\n<div class=\"jwplayer-media\" id=\"botr_vhW9ib0F_rfvUMj7m_div\">\n<img class=\"jwplayer-media-preview\" src=\"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/vhW9ib0F-1920.jpg\" />\n</div>\n\n</div><br /><p></p><p>\n<br />\n</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><br />\n</h2>",

They are also a brilliant time to introduce lasting habits that help <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/education/failure-to-forest-school-azadwadi-udaipur-education-10064717\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">children fall in love with the natural world</a> and grow up with sustainability as second nature.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rather than overwhelming families with rules or guilt, these lesser-known traditions are designed to be joyful, meaningful, and easy to weave into your existing celebrations, whether you live in a flat, have a garden, or only a windowsill. Over time, these small acts become cherished family memories and values that stay rooted for life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here are six lesser-known yet rewarding festival traditions to try.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Rainwater wishes</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What it is:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the days leading up to a festival, place a clean bowl or glass jar outside to collect rainwater. On the morning of the celebration, each family member takes a moment to whisper a wish, hope, or intention into the water. Then, use the water to gently nourish a plant, garden bed, or tree.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why it matters:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Children learn that water is precious, and that nature responds to care and intention. It creates a reflective moment that links them to the environment through something simple and beautiful.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to do:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If it has not rained, collect water from rinsing fruit or boiling vegetables. Use this chance to explain how even &lsquo;used&rsquo; water can have another purpose. Assign one child as the &ldquo;water bearer&rdquo; to help distribute it with care.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Nature-inspired family traditions\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/30/nature-inspired-family-traditions-2025-10-30-11-15-15.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Place a clean bowl or glass jar outside to collect rainwater.

Sunrise start</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What it is:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mark the beginning of a festival by watching the sunrise as a family. Wrap up warmly, bring a flask of tea or warm milk, and simply sit together to welcome the day in stillness.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why it matters:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It encourages children to experience <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/travel/eco-tourism-tourism/kids-nature-walks-india-family-travel-outdoors-learning-wildlife-eco-tourism-10534761\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">natural beauty</a> and stillness before the noise and excitement of a celebration. It also reminds them that time and light are gifts, not just schedules on a screen.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to do:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Check sunrise times the evening before. Choose a safe, outdoor spot, even a balcony or open window works. Let children choose a &ldquo;sunrise song&rdquo; or bring a drawing pad to sketch what they see.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Leaf letters</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What it is:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gather fallen leaves and write short messages of gratitude, kindness, or wishes for others using pencils or homemade ink. During the festival, take a walk and leave the leaf notes in parks, woods, or your own garden for others to find.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why it matters:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This combines art, emotional awareness, and connection to community and nature. It encourages children to think of others and adds a magical, almost secret element to your festival.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to do:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Press the leaves flat in a book a few days ahead. Let children write or decorate them. If you are visiting family or friends, leave a leaf letter as a surprise in their garden or on their doorstep.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Nature-inspired family traditions\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/30/nature-inspired-family-traditions-2025-10-30-11-19-33.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Gather fallen leaves and write short messages of gratitude, kindness, or wishes for others. Photograph: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/an-open-book-with-leaves-on-top-of-it-fMkO2pnEiK0\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(Unsplash)</a></em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. Nature swap box</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What it is:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Create a family nature box where, at each festival, everyone adds a <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/sustainability/leaf-mulching-tips-using-fallen-leaves-for-soil-garden-autumn-healthy-plants-mulch-guide-home-gardeners-10601117\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">small natural object</a>, such as a stone, feather, pressed flower, or shell. During each celebration, participants can exchange an item or select one to discuss.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why it matters:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It builds a timeline of natural discoveries and shows that gifts from the earth can be more meaningful than shop-bought items. It also supports mindful collection, taking only what&rsquo;s fallen and never harming living things.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to do:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Use a wooden box, tin, or basket. Label items with dates or locations. Encourage children to tell a story about the object they choose or add. Over time, the box becomes a family time capsule of your nature journey.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">5. Zero-waste festival picnic</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What it is:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Host a simple, joyful picnic during your festival using only what you already have, no disposables, packaging, or plastic. Include homemade snacks, reusable containers, and nature-inspired table settings.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why it matters:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Children see that celebrations don&rsquo;t need to create waste. Planning and preparing food together also brings a sense of pride and enjoyment in simplicity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Nature-inspired family traditions\" src=\"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/fit-in/580x348/filters:format(webp)/english-betterindia/media/media_files/2025/10/30/nature-inspired-family-traditions-2025-10-30-11-29-12.png\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" />\n<figcaption><em>Let children help with food prep by making fruit skewers or garden-grown nibbles. Photograph: </em><a href=\"https://malvernschool.com/blog/tag/gardening-activities-for-kids?v=malvern\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>(The Malvern School)</em></a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to start:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/458593/grow-bottle-gourd-with-kids-monsoon-gardening-easy-steps-family-activity-children-bond-with-nature/\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">children help with food prep</a> by making sandwiches, fruit skewers, or garden-grown nibbles. Use cloth napkins, metal water bottles, and reusable plates. Decorate with picked herbs or edible flowers. If the weather doesn&rsquo;t allow, hold your picnic indoors.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">6. &ldquo;Thank the Earth&rdquo; closing circle</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What it is:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As your festival winds down, gather the family in a circle, outdoors if possible. Each person takes a turn thanking something from the day, it can be the sun, the trees, the food, or each other.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why it matters:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It brings children into the habit of closing celebrations with gratitude and reflection. It is a gentle way to teach respect for what we consume and enjoy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to start:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Create a small ritual, like lighting a beeswax candle, ringing a bell, or holding a shared object (like a pebble or seed) while speaking. Keep it relaxed and sincere.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These traditions are not about doing things perfectly; they are about weaving care, curiosity, and creativity into moments that already matter. Over time, they become the remembered rituals that children carry with them. By keeping festivals <a href=\"https://thebetterindia.com/sustainability/mumbai-family-raigad-move-farming-homeschooling-permaculture-sustainable-simpler-life-10441098\" rel=\"dofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">close to nature</a> and full of meaning, we can help raise a generation that celebrates gently.</p>",

The show was enormously popular and put Chappelle on the map. <em>Chappelle’s Show</em> was scheduled to have a third season after the success of the first two seasons but that never happened. </p><h4>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/why-dave-chappelle-walked-away-from-50-million-dollars/\">Why Dave Chappelle Walked Away From $50 Million Dollars …</a></h4><p>Instead, Chappelle famously walked away from the series and a $50 million paycheck. He abruptly left during production in 2006, effectively breaking his contract with Comedy Central. He was reportedly unhappy with the direction the show had taken and needed to step away.</p><p>But there has been one person who has been with the comedian through it all and that's his wife, Elaine.</p><h2>Dave and Elaine Chappelle Prioritize Family Over Money</h2><p>In an interview with <em><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20050516081506/https:/www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1061415,00.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Time</a></em>, Chappelle spoke about moving to Ohio and walking away from his show, saying, \"Coming here, I don't have the distractions of fame. It quiets the ego down. I'm interested in the kind of person I've got to become. I want to be well-rounded, and the industry is a place of extremes. I want to be well-balanced. I've got to check my intentions, man.”</p><h4>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/best-dating-quotes/\">Best Dating Quotes to to Keep You Motivated in Your Search for Love</a></h4><p>There was much speculation during this time in Chappelle’s life. Fans couldn’t fathom the idea that he’d walk away from his popular and successful show and $50 million. People thought he must have a drug or alcohol problem. Others thought it was a mental health issue that led comedian Dave Chappelle to walk away from it all. That wasn’t the case at all. Chappelle simply reprioritized his life in a way that was better for himself and his family.</p><p>Through the media circus that followed Dave Chappelle’s wife Elaine Mendoza stood by him. Dave and Elaine have been married for 21 years. They tied the knot in 2001 and have two sons, Sulayman and Ibrahim, and one daughter, Sanaa. </p><h2><strong>Who is Elaine Chappelle</strong>?</h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"elaine chappell\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ef5f6\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/elaine-chappell.png?id=55368792&amp;width=980\" />\n<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Goalcast Archive</small></p>\n<p>Dave Chappelle’s wife Elaine Mendoza was born on August 31, 1974, to devout Christian Filipino parents. (Dave converted to Islam in 1991.) She grew up in Brooklyn and according to various sources, once planned to become a professional chef. Dave and Elaine Chappelle met more than 20 years ago, so she would have been in her 20s. After meeting and falling in love with Dave Chappelle, Elaine chose to devote herself to raising the couple’s three children.</p><h2><strong>How Did Dave Chappelle and Elaine Meet?</strong></h2><div><strong><br /></strong></div><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"dave with his arm around his wife elaine chappell\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"2ca0d\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/dave-with-his-arm-around-his-wife-elaine-chappell.png?id=55368800&amp;width=980\" />\n<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Goalcast Archive</small></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"></figure><p>During an interview with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81yCzWkt8uM\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Howard Stern</a> in the early 2000s, Dave Chappelle revealed that he met his then-girlfriend Elaine Mendoza in Brooklyn and at the time he said she was pregnant with his baby. He said that he was immediately interested in her, but she took some time to get to know Dave before committing to the relationship. </p><h4>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/dave-chappelle-talks-worst-experience-video/\">Dave Chappelle Talks About His Worst Experience</a></h4><p>He also revealed that she was Filipino, which led Stern and his co-host Robin Quivers to make some distasteful jokes about Asian stereotypes. Up until this point Dave Chappelle had been a regular guest on Stern’s show and even credited the exposure Stern gave him with helping his career. After they made those so-called jokes about the future Elaine Chappelle, he has continually refused to ever appear on Stern’s show again. Though he publicly says it’s because the show <a href=\"https://www.thethings.com/why-dave-chappelle-wont-do-the-howard-stern-show-again/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tapes too early in the morning</a>, it feels like he's showing where his loyalties lie – with his wife Elaine Chappelle.</p><h2><strong>Elaine is Dave Chappelle’s Support System</strong></h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"dave chappelle during a comedy routine\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8e22c\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/dave-chappelle-during-a-comedy-routine.png?id=55368803&amp;width=980\" />\n<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Goalcast Archive</small></p>\n<p><br /></p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"></figure><p>Dave and Elaine Chappelle have a strong marriage that has lasted more than two decades so far.

Fans and the media can be brutal to a public figure like Elaine Chappelle’s husband. She has been with Dave through some rocky parts of his career including when he walked away from <em>Chappelle’s Show</em> and the more recent controversy over the <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/dave-chappelle-transphobic-jokes-the-closer-emmy-nomination-1381734/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">anti-trans content</a> in his standup routine. </p><h4>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/relationship-goals-justin-timberlake-and-jessica-biel/\">Relationship Goals: Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel Stepped Back to Leap Forward</a></h4><p>He appreciates the perspective Elaine Chappelle brings to his life and said, \"My wife, if it gets real bad, she’ll let me know, like, ‘Oh, you should look into this.’ But for the most part, I try not to pay attention to it because you don’t want to be careful as a comedian. I try to keep my business small enough so it can still be authentic enough.”</p><p>Speaking of that $50 million Chappelle walked away from when he quit <em>Chapelle’s Show</em> and voided his contract with Comedy Central – Chappelle did an interview with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-4nPqn7Jo\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Conan O’Brien</a> in 2006 during which he talked about it, saying,  “My wife’s still a little salty… She’s not mad at me, but don’t think you’re going to walk away from $50 million and your wife’s just gonna be cool with it.”</p><h2 id=\"h-where-the-married-couple-is-today\"><strong>Where the Married Couple is Today</strong></h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"dave chappelle and his wife elaine\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b6592\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/dave-chappelle-and-his-wife-elaine.png?id=55368806&amp;width=980\" />\n<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Goalcast Archive</small></p><p>Dave and Elaine Chappelle and their three children live on a 65-acre farm in Yellow Springs, Ohio, which is located about 20 miles from the Dayton Metropolitan area.

And they're still culturally relevant. The 2023 film <em>Anyone But You</em> had Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell recreate the Jack and Rose \"leaning over the deck of the Titanic\" scene we'll never forget.</p><hr /><h3>Their First Kiss on the set of the Titanic</h3><br /><img alt=\"titanic movie cover\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"cabc4\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/titanic-movie-cover.jpg?id=55368691&amp;width=1200&amp;height=800&amp;quality=50&amp;coordinates=0%2C206%2C0%2C386\" /><p>Meeting on the set of <em>Titanic</em> in 1997, DiCaprio and Winslet instantly clicked amidst the gruelling seven-month shoot. Their chemistry was palpable, but both actors have insisted that their bond was purely platonic. Winslet once shared that while her friends were swooning over DiCaprio, to her, he was just “silly old Leo.” This early connection started a friendship that would endure the test of time and Hollywood’s pressures.</p><h3>Oscar Buzz and Romance Buzz</h3><br /><img alt=\"Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio at the Golden Globe Awards\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a7acb\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/kate-winslet-and-leonardo-dicaprio-at-the-golden-globe-awards.jpg?id=52499936&amp;width=1200&amp;height=800&amp;quality=50&amp;coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C262\" /><p>Their friendship has only blossomed over the years, punctuated by countless public appearances that left fans buzzing. Take the 1998 Golden Globes, for instance—Leo and Kate’s camaraderie was on full display as they cheered each other on, despite the endless swirl of romantic rumors. This pattern of mutual support and affectionate displays has persisted, proving that true friendship not only survives but thrives under the bright lights of Hollywood’s spotlight.</p><h3>Reuniting On The Silver Screen</h3><br /><img alt=\"Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet smiling on a couch in Revolutionary Road\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d48e4\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/leonardo-dicaprio-and-kate-winslet-smiling-on-a-couch-in-revolutionary-road.jpg?id=51945688&amp;width=980\" /><p>In 2008, DiCaprio and Winslet reunited on screen for <em>Revolutionary Road</em>, a film about a disintegrating marriage. Despite the intense and somewhat uncomfortable scenes, especially with Winslet’s then-husband Sam Mendes directing, their chemistry was as electric as ever. Winslet later reflected on their effortless ability to fall back into sync, likening it to muscle memory. This reunion showcased their incredible acting skills and highlighted the depth of their enduring friendship.</p><h3>She Thanked Leo (Before Her Husband)!</h3><br /><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span><p>At the 2009 Golden Globe Awards, Cameron Diaz and Mark Wahlberg presented the award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Drama to Kate Winslet for her stunning performance in <em>Revolutionary Road</em>. Winslet, overwhelmed with emotion, took the stage and apologized to the other nominees before expressing her disbelief at winning a second award that night.<br /></p><p>In her heartfelt speech, she thanked the Hollywood Foreign Press, her longtime agents, writer Richard Yates, the film’s cast and crew, the producers, the hair and makeup department, her dialect coach, and, notably, her co-star Leonardo DiCaprio before her husband and the film's director, Sam Mendes. Among the nominees were heavyweights like Anne Hathaway, Angelina Jolie, Meryl Streep, and Kristin Scott Thomas.</p><p>Winslet made sure to acknowledge her longtime friend and <em>Revolutionary Road</em> co-star, saying, \"Leo, I'm so happy I can stand here and tell you how much I love you and how much I've loved you for 13 years. Your performance in this film is nothing short of spectacular.\"</p><h3>Leo Walked Kate Down The Aisle</h3><br /><img alt=\"Moet &amp; Chandon Inside Ballroom at the 64th Annual Golden Globe Awards\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"35e51\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/moet-chandon-inside-ballroom-at-the-64th-annual-golden-globe-awards.jpg?id=52499919&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;quality=50&amp;coordinates=0%2C33%2C0%2C1771\" /><p>In 2012, during a secret ceremony in New York, it was rumored that Leonardo DiCaprio gave Kate Winslet away at her wedding to Ned Rocknroll (born Abel Smith). This touching gesture demonstrated the depth of their bond, with DiCaprio standing by his friend’s side during one of the most significant moments of her life. This act of friendship showcased the unwavering support and love they have for each other, further cementing their status as one of Hollywood’s most beloved duos.</p><h3>And The Oscar Goes To...</h3><br /><img alt=\"Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, 88th Annual Academy Awards - Backstage And Audience\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"21d77\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/leonardo-dicaprio-and-kate-winslet-88th-annual-academy-awards-backstage-and-audience.jpg?id=52468845&amp;width=980\" /><p>Who can forget the 2016 Oscars when DiCaprio, finally nominated for his role in <em>The Revenant</em>, surprised Winslet on the red carpet? The reunion sparked joy and nostalgia for fans, reminding everyone of their timeless bond that began with <em>Titanic</em>.</p><p>During DiCaprio’s acceptance speech, Winslet couldn’t hold back her tears. As he spoke about the importance of protecting our planet, the camera caught Winslet’s emotional reaction, proving just how much his success meant</p><h3>They Didn't See Each Other For 3 Years!</h3><br /><img alt=\"Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio's emotional reunion during the pandemic\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"10f45\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/kate-winslet-and-leonardo-dicaprio-s-emotional-reunion-during-the-pandemic.jpg?id=52500009&amp;width=980\" /><p>The COVID-19 pandemic posed a significant challenge to their friendship, as travel restrictions kept them apart. Winslet described their emotional reunion after nearly three years as tear-filled and overwhelming, emphasizing how much they missed each other. “I couldn’t stop crying,” Winslet confessed, illustrating the profound connection they share. This reunion underscored the strength of their bond, one that thrives even in challenging times.</p><p>Their friendship was once again in the spotlight during the release of <em>Titanic's</em> 4K Ultra HD edition, where Winslet reminisced about their early days on set. She described young DiCaprio as a magnetic presence, full of energy and freedom, qualities that made working with him a delightful experience. Winslet’s reflections remind us of the joyful and enduring nature of their bond.</p><h3>Nearly 30 Years of Friendship</h3><br /><img alt=\"The 66th Annual Golden Globe Awards - ET Red Carpet Arrivals\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"62c74\" src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/the-66th-annual-golden-globe-awards-et-red-carpet-arrivals.jpg?id=52499993&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;quality=50&amp;coordinates=0%2C17%2C0%2C545\" /><p>Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet’s friendship is a testament to the enduring power of genuine human connection amidst the glitz and glamour of Hollywood. Their story, filled with shared memories, mutual respect, and unwavering support, continues to inspire fans worldwide. In an industry where relationships can often be fleeting, their bond stands out as a heartwarming example of true friendship.</p><p>From their early days on the <em>Titanic</em> set to walking each other down the aisle and supporting each other’s career milestones, DiCaprio and Winslet's friendship reminds us that childhood friends never get old. As Winslet once said, “We’re bonded for life,” a sentiment that perfectly captures the deep and abiding connection they share.</p>",

      "summary": "<img src=\"https://www.goalcast.com/media-library/woman-at-a-restaurant-s-window-and-two-teen-employees.png?id=52999496&amp;width=1200&amp;height=800&amp;coordinates=188%2C0%2C0%2C0\" /><br /><br /><p>Working in customer service can be challenging, especially when you’re dealing with rude and demanding clients. That’s particularly true for some teens, who work these jobs for part-time <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/how-to-save-money/\" target=\"_blank\">money</a> and are often <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/adult-bullying-is-real-heres-how-to-handle-it/\" target=\"_blank\">bullied</a> by adults. Perhaps that’s why people are applauding these teen girls for the way they expertly handled an over-the-top customer.</p><hr /><h3>An Angry Customer</h3><br /><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\">\n<div style=\"padding: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;\">\n<div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\">\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C883KFHuHkU/\" style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_top\">See on Instagram</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote><p>It was a tough day for employees at Keke’s Snow Balls in Texas when an angry woman approached the window. She had placed a pickup order for a snow cone and because of a shift change, the snow cone wasn’t ready. Two days later, the customer came back and demanded a refund of $6.</p><p>A girl named Victoria was working the counter and listened to the woman’s complaints. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CPIa1OpxEM\" target=\"_blank\">According to <em>Inside Edition</em></a>, it was immediately clear this woman didn’t want to resolve things in the right way, and was trying to pick a fight. Another employee named Kaeley overheard it all.</p><p>“I was just listening in the back and, eventually, I could just hear she’s angry the whole time. So I was like, clearly she just wants to have a problem,” Kaeley recalled to the publication. “And I’m not about that, so I was like, ‘Okay let me just go give her $6 and we can move on, move past this.’ It was $6.”</p><h3>An Unexpected Turn</h3><br /><p>At that point, the situation should have been resolved. However, Kaeley noticed the sign outside the window had fallen over during the dispute. So, she opened the window to fix it. That’s when the woman came by, slapped the sign out of the 17-year-old girl’s hand, and called her a derogatory name.</p><p>“M’am, please don’t act like that. You’re a grown woman,” Kaeley responded in a video that the restaurant then <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@kekessnowballs/video/7385726944513428767\" target=\"_blank\">posted to TikTok</a>. “You’re a grown woman. I’m 17. Get out of here. Don’t come back. Don’t come back. We don’t need your business.”</p><p>“I was scared and very confused,” Victoria added. “I wasn’t understanding what was going on.”</p><h3>A Brilliant Online Reaction</h3><br /><p>After the owner posted the video online, it went viral and many people reached out to support the girls for their perfect reaction to the customer.</p><p>“People were traveling to come and see us from hours away,” the owner, Kyle, told <em>Inside Edition</em>. “We had people reaching out to us on TikTok asking how to tip the girls. We even had people going and leaving Google reviews that haven’t even been to the shop, saying they’re so proud of the girls and how they dealt with it,” he continued. </p><p>Kyle explained that he posted the video to remind everyone that the employees behind the counter are people, too. Adults, in particular, should try to remember that oftentimes, these are kids working to save up for cars, school, and other big life steps.</p><p>“Mistakes happen, but for you to go up and act like that as an adult, my whole point in uploading that video is to simply remind us all that we need to treat people better,” Kyle added.</p><p>\"I am proud of the way our supervisor handled the situation,\" he added in <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C883KFHuHkU/\" target=\"_blank\">the initial post</a>. \"We must strive for better behavior and respect in all interactions. It’s all about just being a kind person and approaching every situation with willingness to come to a good resolution.\"</p><h3>We Are All the Same</h3><br /><p>As Kyle himself said, mistakes happen and no one is perfect. But demanding <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/why-youre-perfect-just-as-you-are/\" target=\"_blank\">perfection</a> of others can be a very lonely way to live. Rather than getting upset over an honest mistake and making someone feel bad or yelling at them, lead with grace and understanding. Not only will you help someone else feel respected, but you’ll probably get a better result from the situation, too.</p><p>When life doesn’t go our way, it can be easy to overreact or blame someone else. But by remembering that mistakes happen and this too shall pass, we can all live a little more peacefully.</p><p>Many of us are in these jobs because we’re trying to provide for our families or ourselves and our futures. Going to work can be hard enough, so remember to thank those who help you in the customer service industry and to tip well when appropriate. After all, we all want to feel appreciated at work. </p>",

One gave the example of a man in assisted living who, when walking to the dining hall, saw kids dressed as aliens for Halloween. He did not handle it well.

I called my mom, who is in a senior living home, and asked if her facility did this. Her answer was surprising: \"I hope not. Where would I even get candy?\"</p><p>But the idea is still a lovely one, at least for some. And if it's something that resonates, here are a few tips for making it work.</p>  <h2>NOTE THE SENIOR FACILITY</h2><p>There's a big difference between senior independent living, assisted living, and memory care. It's important to note that before attempting a visit which includes children. Senior independent would probably be the best place to start, as the residents (often) have fewer physical or memory-health issues.</p>  <h2>CALL AHEAD</h2><p>This might take some time, but call around to different facilities to make sure this is allowed. Usually, this is a planned event on their part, so while they may love the idea, it certainly takes coordination. The site, <a href=\"https://www.aplaceformom.com/lp?&amp;kw=3234-APFM:NB:USA:GOOGLE:Misc:Exact&amp;kwg=&amp;keyword=living%20centers%20near%20me&amp;match=e&amp;device=c&amp;network=g&amp;hcinquiry=&amp;account=Google:APFM:HMI&amp;campaignid=21291296783&amp;adgroupid=161053958783&amp;ad_id=699465812850&amp;geo=9030971&amp;targetID=kwd-379238823828&amp;hl=&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=paid_media_sem&amp;utm_campaign=APFM:NB:USA:GOOGLE:Misc:Exact&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=living%20centers%20near%20me&amp;attribution_id=155&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21291296783&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADkMj5LraGz6BJrudl9WlbYgrYftu&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw9obIBhCAARIsAGHm1mQuwP40BAee7ghBOdgtWQy7UlChEBQK8cF2g9gf29ZEQxSO49AOkgUaAi2AEALw_wcB\" target=\"_blank\">A Place for Mom </a>can offer a list of nearby residences.</p><h2>OFFER A DONATION </h2><p>Getting out and getting candy (or having the funds to do so) should also be a consideration for something like this. One idea is that once you've established that a facility is hosting an event like this (and/or is open to it), consider offering money to buy the actual candy. Or one could drop the candy off. </p>",
